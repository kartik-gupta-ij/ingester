Similar to how the recommendation API works, but applied in the database.\n\nI'm working on an image-based product recommendation system. Each product has multiple images, and using all of them might improve the search results. I've seen the recommendation api where you can provide multiple positive and negative examples during the search what is great, and I've also read that we can store multiple vectors and search them by selecting one. My question is: can I store multiple image vectors for one pint (product) and, when searching, have the system create an average of those vectors to improve the search accuracy like as positive examples?"

As I understand it there are two main ways to do this and I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction as to what will be completed most efficiently:\n1. Use the scroll function and filters to get all the UUIDs of the points I would like to delete and perform the deletion command on these ids or \n2. Use the delete command directly and use the filter argument within this function\n\nThe second part of my question is related to the size of deletion made. \n\nI've split out the points to delete based on a integer payload field that has seven options. My plan was to iterate through the seven categories of this payload field and perform my deletion and upsert sequentially (seven times) because it matches how our text scraping pipeline operates. \n\nHowever, I am wondering if it is more efficient for qdrant to have one large deletion and upsertion action rather than seven back to back."

I came to realise afterwards that it cannot be loaded to memory in local mode (that is the default setting in private-gpt for small RAG question answer setups). I am now trying to update the collection so that it can be used in on_disk mode. I tried to do it through server mode (docker image running on my laptop). However I am unable to make the server recognize the collection. It creates new folder \"collections\" in the storage directory when docker container is started. I copied the said collection to this folder, but it did not reconize any collection. The only way I found was to upload the collection through the web interface (http://localhost:6333/dashboard#/collections). Only .snapshot and .tar files can be uploaded (private-gpt creates a \"qdrant/collection/make_this_parameterizable_per_api_call/storage.sqlite\" and \"qdrant/meta.json\"). I created a .tar from the meta.json and the sqline and tried to upload it through web ui (took 30+ GB of memory, it started some kind of processing in my nvidia GPU [Ada2000 8 GB vram]). I killed the VM (as it would have taken many hours for this with no gurantee of results).\n**Question**:\nHow can I make this collection useable through qdrant server? Is the upload through web-ui the only way to do it? Do I need to change the directory structure of the two files? I see that the test collections available in the web ui have a different structure (multiple folders and files), while the private-gpt (=llamaindex) created collections has only 1 file (sqlite, meta.json, and other jsons for docs and index). I would really appreciate any help if this collection can be modified somehow and made useable. Otherwise I will have to redo all 900 PDFs through a serve mode again."

We have it like this to lower the expenses.\n\nWe are running our own distributed environment of Qdrant on AWS EC2. We only have 3 nodes: 1 in EU, 1 in Asia, and 1 in US. Each of them has its own EC2 instance, and runs through a Docker container. Qdrant version is 1.2.2.\n\nThere is only 1 shard (the one initially created in the first node, which was EU). We then replicated the shard onto the other 2 nodes. This makes it so that all the data is in sync and present in all nodes (and we need that).\n\n1st question: how do you recommend updating the version of Qdrant? 1 node at a time, and we update every minor, correct? Basically we could start by simply building a new docker image using 1.3.0 (the version immediately after 1.2.2), deploy it in Asia, and wait for it to have an ok status, be in sync, etc. Then we would move on to US, etc. Is this the way to go? Is there a specific version of Qdrant we should aim to update to?\n\n2nd question: We have a new ML model and we basically have to migrate all our data to the new format. For this we thought about uploading a snapshot to s3 (backup), creating a new collection through a separate server that we boot up just during the migration, recalculate all the vectors, replicate in the other two nodes, and then swap the alias to the new collection. Thoughts? Are there easier ways or something we might be missing?\n\nThanks!"

I used a multivector collection:\n```py\nqdrant_client = QdrantClient(host=\"localhost\", port=6333)\nqdrant_client.recreate_collection(\n    collection_name=\"titles_collection\",\n    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=text_embeddings.shape[1],\n    distance=qdrant_models.Distance.COSINE,\n    multivector_config=models.MultiVectorConfig(\n            comparator=models.MultiVectorComparator.MAX_SIM\n        ),),\n)```\n\nFor the embeddings I used a CLIP model and stored the embeddings as such:\n```py\n# Preparing points to upload\npoints = [\n    qdrant_models.PointStruct(\n        id=row['id'],\n        vector=[image_embedding.tolist(), text_embedding.tolist()],\n        payload={'title': row['title']}\n    )\n    for row, image_embedding, text_embedding in zip(df.to_dict(orient='records'), image_embeddings, text_embeddings)\n]\n\n# Upload points to Qdrant\nqdrant_client.upsert(\n    collection_name=\"titles_collection\",\n    points=points,\n)```\n\nHowever, when I tried to query by following the documentation code for multivectors:\n```py\ntitle = [\"Person Wearing Something\"]\ninputs = tokenizer.tokenize(title).to(device)\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    query = model.encode_text(inputs).cpu().numpy()\n\nsearch_results = qdrant_client.query(\n    collection_name=\"titles_collection\",\n     query=[query[0],query[0]],\n)```\n\nI got the error `TypeError: QdrantFastembedMixin.query() missing 1 required positional argument: 'query_text'`\n\nHelp would be much appreciated!

We noticed that the memory consumption of the cluster keep increasing and not released after deleting the collection.\n\n**Details of the issue:**\nWe have a Qdrant cluster with collection that are setup in a blue / green manner with daily reindexing. Each day, we delete the collection that is not currently in use (flagged by an alias), recreate the collection with the new data, and switch the alias to the new collection. We noticed that the memory consumption of the cluster keep increasing and not released after deleting the collection. It reaches the point where it consumes more than the k8s memory request and I am afraid that the pod will be evicted.\n\nIf we restart the cluster, the consumption seems to be normal again. But that's not a solution.\n\nWe don't set any k8s memory limit, do you think it could improve the situation somehow?\n\nI enclose a graph of memory consumption, blue line is used memory (`kubernetes.memory.working_set`), pink link is memory request.

Should this be proportional to `m`? Or proportional to the number of payload fields?

Later, I added 2 more documents to the same directory. When I create the vector store again, I want to understand how it handles the existing and new documents.\n\nQuestion:\nWhen I recreate the vector store after adding the new documents, does it:\n- Recreate the vector store by reprocessing the original 3 documents along with the embeddings of the 2 newly added documents, and then update the cloud?\n- Only create embeddings for the 2 new documents and add them to the existing vector store in the cloud without reprocessing the original 3 documents?\n\nUnderstanding this behavior is crucial for optimizing our workflow and avoiding redundant processing."

Basically, the normal \"recommend\" with positive/negatives + best_score strategy, as well as the Discover functionality with the paired list + a target vector. I see this is in the documentation:\n\n\"Context Search: Without a target, .....the maximum score a point can achieve is 0.0, meaning many points may have a score of 0.0.\n\nTarget Search: When a target is provided......the integer part represents the rank with respect to the context, and the decimal part relates to the distance to the target. The context score for each pair is +1 if the point is closer to a positive example than to a negative example, and -1 otherwise.\"\n\nWhen I run the search with a target, a lot of my scores are very negative (like -16) or very positive (+11).  Is it a proper interpretation that the \"11\" and the \"-16\" part then refer to the \"rank with respect to the context\", and the decimal after it is the distance to the target. Aka, something VERY positive in this case is probably a very relevant item?\n\nLikewise, when I run this search without a target vector and just the paired list, my scores end up ranging from -.79 to -2.7, but I've also seen it be a mix of positive and negative. and from my understanding, the perfect score in this case is \"0\".  Is doing some sort of absolute value on this (aka sorting by distance to 0) the right idea?"

Break up the filepath items into three separate indexed payloads of type 'keyword' (e.g. Drive='D:\\\\', Directory='Working', File extn='.docx')\n\nAre you able to advise if there are any adverse performance issues with the first option (e.g. slower filter/search speeds)?

    "messages": "Hello, I like to make use of query filters to add a keyword based approach on top of the vector search, I know its not the best idea of all but in my use case it does make some sense....\n\nI did create the data in qdrant using llama_index the data is indexed as documents. So now when I add any query_filters I do get non results when using the must filter or I get all the data when using the must_not filter. This shows me I do something very wrong. The filter has not the effect I would expect. When using must_not it brings back data where that words are still in.\n\nWould you mind to share an example of how to do a must/must_not filter on data that has been indexed using llama_index?\n\nMy guess is I'm pointing the filter to the wrong field to be filtered on, but llama_index does not show any examples of how to do so except when using the query_engine. I'm doing a direct search from the qdrant client as this also allows for paged results, which the query_engine does not support.\n\nit looks like this:\n        vector = embed_model.get_text_embedding(query)\n        result = qdrant_client.search(collection_name='someCollection',\n                                            query_vector=vector,\n                                            limit=limit,\n                                            offset=(offset+1)*limit,\n                                            query_filter= filters\n                                            )\n\nThe filter would look like this:\n\n        for word in must_words.split(','):\n            must_filter.append(FieldCondition(\n                key=\"text\",\n                match=MatchText(\n                    text=f\"{word}\"\n                )\n            ))\n\nI use the key text as I think that's where the text gets stored in by llama_index. but I got a strong feeling that's not how it will work as it just does not work 🙂\n\nAny advice is highly welcome 🙂"

I am trying to transfer the data from my 100+ collections to a single collection (\"collection_main\"). In order to do so, I am using the python client's `scroll` to get Records, added in `group-id` to payload, and converting the Records received to Points using the `PointStruct` model. Next, I use `upload_records` to upload to \"collection_main\", with ` parallel=4, max_retries=3` . Throughout the process, I keep track of the number of points at the following stages: 1) Initial collection count (using `count` method with `exact=true`), 2) After converting to `PointStruct`, 3) Checking total number of points from specific `group_id` after upload, all of which tally. However, when I run a separate script (using `count` with `exact=true`) to count the points immediately after the initial script which does the data transfer, I notice data loss within some collections, with some collections having 0 points. \n\nI have ran this script multiple times and noticed that the same few collections face the issue with the same number of points lost. \n\nFor further context, I am running qdrant on a local docker container and using a local directory as the persistent store. Additionally, these collections were initially created in version 1.6.1 (which might explain the need to convert from `Record` to `PointStruct` despite the deprecation of `Record`. And before running the data transfer script, I have progressively mounted the local directory to the intermitent docker container versions (1.6.1 -> 1.7.2 -> 1.8.0 -> 1.9.0 -> 1.9.1).\n\nIs there any reason why this may be happening?

Maybe Qdrant has something to handle this, or maybe you could give me some tips. \nSo, this is the scenario:\nI have some filters for category_id, and gender_id. This part has no problems, I will just use `scroll` api alongside with `scroll_filters` to retrieve the products in this criteria. Also, keep in mind that I am using `limit` and `offset` to handle pagination in qdrant side. \nOne extra filter that I am having problem with, is that, there is a field named `group_id` in products. I want to get only one product of each `group_id`, so if scroll is going to return two or more products having the same `group_id`, it shouldn't. It should return only one of them (does not matter which one).\nOne easy way is to just remove those after getting the product list from `scroll` api, but as I mentioned before, I am using qdrant for pagination. So, this would mess up the pagination by potentially changing the number of final products by eliminating some of them. So, is there any way to handle this in the scroll api?"

Now, for attribute filters, user should be able to filter based on size, color, material, and etc.  These filters should be inclusive of all th attributes of all the candidates of this specific custom category filter. But extracting them from all 10000 candidates every time the request is called is not the best solution. \n## What are my options?\nSo, one possible way to handle this is using redis cash (as the custom categories are limited, we can use redis and just update the filters to include newly added products periodically). But still, we would need to first retrieve all the possible candidates that fits in that custom category, and then process them in python to extract their attributes. \nSo, one may think that I have to just retrieve all the points at first, then separate their attributes. It may work, because I will give these to celery workers to run in a specified time in the background. But, can I just do something to only retrieve the needed attribute fields, and instead of repeating color=green for 3000 products, for example, just get color=green once, without the need to repeat it?\n\nSomething similar can be done in pg for example, using DISTINCT or something."

So, we have a field in our payload named `source_country`:\n```\n{\n  ... other fields in payload,\n  \"source_country\": \n    {\n      \"id\": 45,\n      \"iso\": \"cn\", \n      \"name\": \"china\"\n    },\n  ... other fields in payload,\n}\n```\nWe also may have other source countries, like Turkey, etc. The filtration  that I want to add, is to retriece the china products at first, but also return others as well. I just want to prioritize the china source, without excluding other countries. \nThe reason I want to do this with Qdrant and not after retrieving the results, (which makes more sense to just re-order the results myself), is due to the limitation I am facing for pagination. I am using FastAPI with Qdrant, which forces me to handle pagination in Qdrant side using `offset` and `limit` keywords in `search` and `recommend` apis. So, I am only getting `limit` number of products each time, which is equal to `per_page` param sent by the client, which is 12 or 10 mostly. \nSo, re-ordering 12 products is not going to work here. \nIf you think my approach is wrong in other places, and I can do something else entirely to not face this prioritizing issue, please let me know. If more details is needed, just tell me what you need to know in order to offer help.\n\nP.S. I checked this `order_by` payload key doc in the scroll api, (I am not using scroll, but anyway), it says:\n\"When you use the order_by parameter, pagination is disabled.\"\n\nThanks in advance for your time and help."

It appears to happen after the first node has been replaced, other nodes get into a crashloopbackoff. It's strange.\n\nI have a hunch this is related to the fact that we are storing the data on ephemeral storage now, and not a network connected ssd, because it was too slow.\n\nSo my question is - is qdrant _supposed_ to be able to recover shards from its peers? Or am I misunderstanding how qdrant in cluster mode is supposed to work?\n\n\nWhen we were using persistent volumes, we were able to delete a node and bring it back - but it seems when using local disk we cant currently.

When creating a shard, we specify a replication factor of 2 as follows:\n\n_, err := p.collectionsClient.CreateShardKey(ctx, &pb.CreateShardKeyRequest{\n        CollectionName: collectionName,\n            Request: &pb.CreateShardKey{\n                ShardKey: &pb.ShardKey{\n                    Key: &pb.ShardKey_Keyword{Keyword: <uuid>},\n                },\n                ReplicationFactor: 2\n            },\n        })\n\nHowever, when any qdrant node is reassigned by kubernetes, the cluster temporarily becomes unavailable. When upserting points, I get a lot of errors like the one below:\n\nrpc error: code = Internal desc = Service internal error: Tonic status error: status: Unavailable, message: \"Failed to connect to http://qdrant-52.qdrant-headless:6335/, error: transport error\", details: [], metadata: MetadataMap { headers: {} }\n\nAssuming the shard was replicated, I'd expect the write to succeed accessing the available shard? I use ordering WEAK on upserts and set wait to false\n\nIt sometimes takes ~30min for the node to finish recovery and start serving. There are currently no deletes in the collection,  only upsert traffic with sporadic search requests for testing.\n\n1. Is there a requirement for all nodes (peers) to be available? How can we leverage replication to avoid getting these errors?\n\n2. How can I confirm that the shards in the cluster are replicated? What endpoint can I use to get the per shard replication state, and confirm that created custom shards are actually replicated?\n\nThank you!"

I am also running a k8s job that I created which iterates through each sts endpoint and collection and takes a snapshot of the each. I have also attached the snapshot pvcs and an Azure file share to the k8s job. I do know that I can attached the files share as the path for snapshots, but its really hard to tell which node in the cluster the snapshot originated from since they are all named similarly. \n\nWith that said, I do have a few questions.\n\n1. Is it possible to uniquely name a snapshot?\n2. Is there a recommended approach for taking and storing multinode snapshots in Azure? \n3. Is there something similar to an Elasticsearch repo plugin available for Qdrant? \n4. Is there a way to check the status of a currently running snapshot?  I am running snapshots with 'wait=false''. The only GET I see is to download snapshots.\n5. Does the snapshot in the snapshots folder only show up once the snapshot has completed?\n6. Does a snapshot creation/deletion impact data ingestion/search?\n7. Can snapshot creation happen at the same time as deletion?\n8. In the snapshots section of a collection in the Qdrant dashboard, the snapshots that are available seem to alternate between snapshots on each node when the browser page is refreshed. Is this the expected way to view all snapshots on all nodes when viewing the dashboard?"

For de-duping I am using Qdrant. I read these docs in a batch of 100 from a database, check for de-dupe in qdrant (in a range from last 2 days), do a bunch of processing, and write these articles back to database, and also to qdrant so that it can be used for de-dupe for the next batch. \n\nCurrently, I am running qdrant from docker on a singe AWS node with enough disk-space. This DB contains a few other collections which are small (~500 vectors). Only this collection that is being used for de-dupe contains ~3M docs (spanning 2 days). I have a separate cron job that deletes docs from this collection that are older than 2 days, so that the number of docs are around 3M. The delete job uses a search filter on a timestamp payload, which is indexed (as is available in the current version of qdrant). Each point has some small amount of payload, which I have moved to disk (`\"on_disk_payload\":true`)\n\nI am noticing that each batch_query with 100 docs starts off at ~0.35s and then keeps increasing linearly. At some point, the client starts timing out. \n\nQuestions:\n- Should the batch-query with 100 docs on a collection containing ~3M vectors take 0.35s? \n- What else optimizations I should use? Should I increase the shard count?"

We've been using OpenSearch, but for our new feature the scale (start with 100M vectors with dim 512 as of now, but likely around 500M quite soon), and filtering requirements (most often 1-20% of the records relevant, but can be significantly more), this might be better dealt with using a dedicated vector DB. \n\nThe dataset will be quite static, maybe monthly updates on small parts of the docs to start with but later most likely 1-2 times a year. Latency is more important than RPS. Most likely couple of thousands request per month to start with.\n\nIs this workload ill suited for one index? One alternativ is to split up the docs into multiple indexes and then query those relevant to the query, but that comes with the overhead of managing multiple indexes, as well as more complex search logic.\n\nCould such a workload be well dealt with using Qdrant, you think?

    "messages": "We have a Langchain/OpenAI-based RAG solution (Python) using Qdrant as our vector db (thru AWS).  It has been in Beta with several clients for 2-3 months now.  We currently segregate each client by giving them a distinct collection.  Most clients have given excellent reviews and are very happy with testing results.  But one client recently said that they were uploading new documents and are not able to get answers (they basically get \"I don't know the answer\" to everything, which is how our prompt is configured).\n\nI decided to load their documents (approx. 40-50K small PDFs) into a new (temporary) collection earlier today.  I can search the vectors (thru web collection console) for the specific file name  that we are wanting to query.  It is definitely present in the collection.  But if I ask a specific question for a topic I see in the vector \"page content\", I get \"I don't know\" answer -- for EVERYTHING.   Again, all other client collections are working (near) perfectly when we ask questions.\n\nNow, I loaded the one single document that has our desired information (vs. 40-50K docs) into yet another temporary collection.  Same test, same questions -- WORKS PERFECTLY NOW!\n\nSo the first temporary collection has about 70K points.  The second temporary collection (single doc) has 11 points.\n\nMy only conclusion (based on above tests) is that collection size somehow is in play here.  Same document in both collections -- but when it is surrounded by 70K *other* docs, my Q&A search (from langchain) is not yielding an answer -- only when it is by itself.\n\nThoughts?  Thanks!

But the problem is that all the data important for searching, are in different columns and I do not think (correct me if I am wrong) generating vector embeddings separately for all the columns is the best solution.\n\nI came up with the idea of mixing the columns together and generating separate collections; and I came up with this solution because the title, the category, brand and attrs columns are essentially the same just in different langs.\n\nAlso I use the \"BAAI/bge-m3\" model which is a multilingual text embedding model that supports more than 100 langs.\n\nSo, in short, I created different collections for different languages, and for each collection I have a vector column containing the vector for the combined text of title, brand, color, and category in each language and when searched, because we already know which language the website is, we will search in that specific language collection.\n\nNow, the question is, is this a valid method? What are the pros and cons of this method? I know for sure that when combined, I can not give different weights to different parts of this vector. For example one combined text of title, category, color, and brand may look like this:\n\n\"Koala patterned hoodie children blue Bubito\"\n\nor Something like:\n\n\"Striped t-shirt men navy blue Zara\"\n\nNow, user may search \"blue hoodie for men\", but due to the un-weighted structure of the combined vector, it will not retrieve the best results.\n\nI may be wrong and this may be one of the best results, but please tell me more about the pros and cons of this method, and if you can, give me a better idea."

Anyway all the questions had the right answer, also the question related to the two new chunks added to knowledge base.\n\nAfter other few messages, I asked again a question related to new chunks and the bot didn't respond correctly, as in the same question of 3 previous messages. I refreshed again the \"Collection Info\" webpage and checked the number of vectors and points count and the number was 17, so the same number of vectors of the collection before running the code. I continued to test, but both counts were 17 for the rest of the session.\n\nthis is just an example, in other sessions the \"behaviour\" of the collection was different, but the end was the same\nThere is something wrong regarding the creation of the collection and its updates. The issue could be related to a not update version of dependencies, because the code stopped to work 10 days ago after Langchain-related dependencies' updates and I installed the previous versions of the dependencies to have the bot active and working properly. In the next message I'm going to provide the code and the list of dependencies"

With custom sharding, is there only one shard per specified custom shard? Or can there be multiple? i.e. If there's a custom shard for client=123 and this customer has 10x the data of the others, will this be split into sub-shards? This is an issue we have with our data where there are lots of smaller clients and some clients up to 100 times bigger than these."

The cluster is under negligible load (~10% of CPU / ~10 rps) and has 30% of its memory available. Removing all load does not materially change the latency of my query.\n\nI have a batch recommend query that is part of my critical path wherein I am providing on the order of 250-300 requests in the batch (with 1 positive point id in each request). A keyword filter is applied to the payload (which is indexed). I also specify a limit and similarity threshold. For the query I am testing against the candidate set of points after applying the payload filter is on the order of 10,000. I am using the `lookup_from` option as the points provided in the request are in a different collection from the collection I seek recommendations from. I am only requesting the payload (which I understand is stored on disk) and not the vectors; however, when I test requesting neither the payload nor the vector, the decrease in latency is marginal, so the fetching of payloads does not appear to be a material contributor to the overall latency.\n\nIt should be noted that I have tested this query also using batch search rather than recommend to control for the influence of `lookup_from`, and there appeared to be no material difference between the two.\n\nThis request consistently takes roughly 1.5 seconds to complete. This is wall clock time from before performing the request to receiving the response. This latency is the observed latency when performing it against collections that do not have quantization enabled and that store 1536 dimension ada embeddings using cosine similarity.\n\nMore details follow as it exceeds the max message size..."

Part of the algorithm of what to show next involves cosine similarity, which we implement with Qdrant search. There are about 50-100k different items/vectors and the key is that users should not see items that were recommended to them in the past again. Right now we are implementing this with a must_not filter on the IDs of all seen items, which we are storing separately. However this doesn't seem very scalable (?) once we reach >1k previously seen items per user, which we are getting to quickly for some users. Any thoughts/recommendations for this use case? Can Qdrant handle >1k or even >10k must_not filters by id? Should we handle this by post-processing instead -> having qdrant return hundreds of results and then do post-processing to remove already-seen ones with a bloom filter or Redis or some other efficient algorithm?"

Importantly, each document is associated with only one group, and the payload includes a group ID, for example: {..., \"group_id\": 12345, ...}.\n\nWhen conducting a search on behalf of a user, our goal is to retrieve documents whose vectors closely match a given vector, but exclusively from groups to which the user belongs.\n\nSo if we will blindly construct a query to obtain the necessary data, the filter section of this query could potentially contain up to 10K clauses\nFor example in \"filter\".\"should\" array:\n\"should\": [\n        { \"key\": \"group_id\", \"match\": { \"value\": 111222 } },\n        { \"key\": \"group_id\", \"match\": { \"value\": 12346 } },\n        ...

Our platform, among other functionalities, allows one or more users to hold a video conference. During the conference, our system records content from various sources and converts it to embeddings.\n\nI'd like to learn more about Qdrant and see if it is a good fit with our system. Here are a couple of questions:\n\n- Ideally we would like each meeting to be encapsulated in an isolated collection of vectors, for various reasons, such as improved retrieval, access permissions etc. I was looking at one of the threads from earlier today that mentioned too many collections being an anti-pattern in Qdrant. I am curious to hear your thoughts about our use case.\n\n- As a follow up question, I am also curious to learn more about the metadata filtering approach that Qdrant takes. I could imagine emulating the isolation above by querying on metadata, but these queries tend to degrade performance. How is metadata filtering implemented? All I could  find on the subject is: https://qdrant.tech/articles/filtrable-hnsw/ but it is unclear if this is the currently used approach and how performant it is.\n\n- How does memory management work in Qdrant? Suppose we run our instance as a Docker container and each collection is memory-mapped. Suppose also that our data does not fully fit in the allocated memory. Is there a caching policy to swap out collections or segments in this case (and if so what is it)? How is this affected by the large number of collections that our use case requires? Will this guarantee that the instance never runs out of memory and fails?\n\nI am looking forwards to hearing your thoughts.\n\nThanks!"

What I mean by this is that raft info is not the same, the shard information is not consistent (some nodes report shard as being active with an active transfer, some report the same shard as dead).  There are also error like this one: \"error\": \"Service internal error: The replica set for shard 0 on peer 1160470838309247 has no active replica\". Many collections report a pending shard with shard transfer in progress but  those seem to be stuck. We tried to cancel one of them, kill the resulting dead shard and initiate a new copy but it does not seem to be working (no progress).\nAll nodes are accessible and not stuck.\nI have a couple of questions:\n    1) Is there a guide or a document with a set of troubleshooting steps?\n    2) Is there a configuration in place to prevent system from initiating shard transfer automatically when a node goes down (it's better to wait until node is back up rather than initiate a shard transfer which would not be needed after just few minutes)?\nThank you."

Previously, we have been using Qdrant Cloud, but now we are interested in deploying on our own. I have a couple of questions regarding this transition:\n\n1. Is it possible to directly migrate our data from Qdrant Cloud to our self-hosted environment on AWS?\n\n2. What is the recommended deployment approach for a dataset that fits within 64GB of memory? I'm considering different options such as:\n   - A single EC2 instance with 64GB of memory\n   - Four EC2 instances, each with 16GB of memory\n   - A Kubernetes setup (probably EKS, if we choose AWS)\n\nGiven our team's limited familiarity with Kubernetes and considering management costs, a single EC2 instance seems to be a feasible option. However, I am curious to know if this is a generally recommended practice or if there are better alternatives.\n\nAny guidance or best practices you can provide on this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards"

Upon inspecting the logs, it was clear that we were running out of memory.\nThe metrics indicated a continuous increase in RAM usage without any subsequent decrease. After restarting the cluster, the issue persisted. It was only resolved when we deleted all the collections.\nIn our app, we utilize 'knowledge bases', which can consist of one or multiple embedded files. Our approach has been to create a new collection for each knowledge base.\nAccording to our research and documentation review, it's recommended to store all knowledge bases in a single collection, using fields like knowledgebase_id in the payload. This approach should include filtering that field for context retrieval of the wanted knowledge base. Also, we found that using In Disk storage and indexing on the knowledgebase_id field will help us mitigate this issue.\nWe're considering implementing these changes and possibly exploring quantization if necessary.\nWe would greatly appreciate your insights and suggestions on this situation. Any additional best practices or improvements are welcome."

I define a large filter as a filter with a must clause on that indexed \"locationId\" field where the array has more than 1,000 items. Most of the time, results just time out. Remove the filter and results are speedy.\n\nWhat's strange is that the dev environment is basically provisioned in the exact same way. The differences that I can tell are that dev receives less writes and has a smaller vector count: 1,887,821. Queries on my dev system don't usually time out. \n\nI'm looking for advice on diagnosing what the issue is. Why is it that it works on dev and not live?

I have been trying out qdrant to do vector based search given these vectors, but I'm running into prohibitively slow query times which I really hope someone could help me solve. \n\n**My usecase:**\nI need to query a vector database containing ~10 million vectors of dimension ~2000. These queries need to return the most similar vector for each query vector. Returning the top 5 or top 10 would be nice, if possible. I need to be able to process at least 100.000 query vectors pr. 24 hours, which is just around 1 query pr. second.  It is OK if parallelism is required to achieve these speeds. \n\n** What I have tried:**\nI have so far worked with a local database containing a single vector collection. I have not used the docker image because I do not have rights to run docker images locally, and I have assumed that converting it to a singularity image wouldn't work (correct me if I'm wrong!).  I have attached a MWE of my code in this message.\n\nHere's what I find using the attached MWE:\n\nFor a database containing 10.000 vectors of length 1024, I am able to execute  `QdrantClient.search(.. limit = 1)` about 11 times a second. \n\nFor a database containing 50.000 vectors of length 1024, I am able to execute `QdrantClient.search(.. limit = 1)` about 2 times a second. \n\nAs soon as the databases begin to be semi-realistic in size (~1 million vectors), the query speeds are prohibitively slow, essentially making qdrant unusable for me. \n\nThese tests were carried out on a beefy workstation with 1TB of RAM,  2X AMD EPYC CPUs and the database was stored on a fast NVME drive.\n\n\n**Could you please take a quick look and let me know  if I am missing something?**"

This would require less data to be copied and thus less susceptible to connectivity issues but I don't see any built-in way to backfill data into an already populated collection (i.e. there is no native method to do this nor do I see any way to return all vectors in a collection so that I can upload them to another collection)\n\nPlease advise on how to go about updating a cluster version while minimizing lost data."

This production database will also be used for vector similarity queries the whole time on a read-only basis.  I want to make sure that we don't disrupt or slow the read processes by writing new data.   When a new vector and payload is added  the index will be rebuilt.  By default will this cause any latency or outage issues on the production reads?  Is there a way to stop that happening?  I guess what I would like is that the old index is used up until the moment that the new index has already been rebuilt and then is instantaneously is switched in.  In my use case it doesn't matter if there is a delay for the new data becoming available on search.  \n\nI've had a look at the docs and I can't quite see how it works.  Thanks"

Before I encountered the same problem but earlier. I searcht the discord and found a page that referred to the tutorial about bulk upload: https://qdrant.tech/documentation/tutorials/bulk-upload/. I followed the instructions in  the tutorial. I have now created the collection like this:\n```client.create_collection(\n    collection_name=\"test_collection\",\n    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=20, \n                                distance=Distance.DOT, \n                                on_disk=True))\n\nclient.create_payload_index(collection_name='test_collection', \n                            field_name='doc_id', \n                            field_schema='integer')\nclient.update_collection(\n    collection_name=\"test_collection\",\n    optimizer_config=models.OptimizersConfigDiff(indexing_threshold=0,\n                                                  memmap_threshold=None),\n    \n)````\nIf I understand this correctly all the points should be placed on disk, no indexing should take place untill i up the threshold again, and also no power is lost on the memmap. There is plenty of storage left on the device. Therefore i dont understand why the service is having problems.\n\nAlso, once the service is killed during upload, I cannot restart the service anymore. It gives a similar error while loading the collection\n```INFO storage::content_manager::toc: Loading collection: test_collection\n./entrypoint.sh: line 25:     7 Killed                  ./qdrant $@ ```\n\nDoes anybody know what I am doing wrong?"

(https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/search/#batch-recommendation-api)\n\nFor instance, let's say that I want to search for the following list of ids : [1,2,3].\n\nI will send each vector in a RecommendRequest like this : \n\n`RecommendRequest(positive=[****], negative=[], filter=None, params=None, limit=30, offset=0, with_payload=True, with_vector=None, score_threshold=None, using=None, lookup_from=None)`\n\nNow let's imagine that one of these points is missing : id = 2 is not in the Qdrant database for a random reason. When one of the points of the batch is missing in my Qdrant database, I get an error for the entire batch instead of just ignoring this particular id.\n\nI would like to be able to retrieve the recommendation for the existing points and ignore the errors when a point is missing. In my case, the expected result would have been a response for id=1 and id=3, while ignoring the error for id=2.\n\nIs it possible using the current recommend_batch() method in python or do I have to use the simple recommend() method for each point ? \n\nThank you very much and sorry if my question is not clear enough !"

Why memory utilization dropped & CPU increased because of the upgrade (was payload pushed entirely to PVs?)\n2. What might've changed in this upgrade that could cause this latency increase - do we need to upgrade our Python client version or change how we're querying the database?\n\nOne other potential relevant piece of information is that we're running several collections that use payload indexing on the same cluster (for isolation and simplicity). I know this isn't recommended, but it seemed to work fine with version 1.4.1 - did something change about how things works?"

In our previous projects involving vector databases, we were storing Payload data in a NoSQL database, enabling simultaneous operation with the vector database. Despite qdrant having a vector database feature, it allows filtering on payload data at an entry level. In this context, we are curious if it's truly necessary to use NoSQL for data matching purposes since qdrant already provides payload functionality.\n\nAdditionally, we like to learn about the depth limit in nested filtering operations?\n\nWarm regards."

It *seems like* it doesn't return duplicates, however. I also don't see anything about that in the [API spec](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html#tag/points/operation/search_batch_points).\n\nThe team is interested in running a search **for each vector** and then returning the hits that appear the most. For example, suppose I have 50 text/natural language queries and want to run a search against each 50 of those. Assume each query returns the same item ID for all 50 searches. In that instance I'd want to bubble that result up to the top. If the API supported returning duplicates, then we could count occurence of each id and then bubble those up. However, the result of `search_batch` doesn't seem to return duplicates, It seems to just return `50*k` unique hits.\n\nI can achieve the above by making 50 unique calls, but thats horribly inefficient. Is there a way to return duplicates with batch searching? Or is the return of batch search already doing this for me, bubbling up results that occur many times inside the HNSW store?"

We are currently using a topography of one Qdrant collection per high-level grouping, and then using metadata tags (probably 2 or 3 max) to be able to further filter our searches.  If we had a metadata tag with a key name of \"tag2\", let us say that some items might have that populated with a specific value (\"123\", \"456\", etc.), but others might have a value of \"$$$\" to indicate a global item (which should be searched/included for all \"tag2\" values).  Then we need to also include another metadata tag/filter (i.e. \"tag1\") on top of that.\n\nMy trouble/issue seems to be around how to properly construct my Langchain retriever to do such a search -- basically I want to set my retriever filter to be something like:\n\n`where \"tag1\" = \"{some-value}\" AND where (\"tag2\" = \"{some-tag2-value}\" OR \"tag2\" = \"$$$\")`\n\nI found one example on the internet that showed the following approach, but it definitely is not working as expected:\n\n`retriever.search_kwargs = dict(\n    filter=qdrant_models.Filter(\n        must=[\n            qdrant_models.FieldCondition(\n                key=\"tag1\",\n                match=qdrant_models.MatchValue(value=\"abc\")\n            ),\n            qdrant_models.FieldCondition(\n                key=\"tag2\",\n                match=qdrant_models.MatchAny(any=[\"$$$\", \"123\"])\n            )\n        ]\n    )\n)`\n\nHopefully that makes sense -- I am basically needing compound metadata filtering (using 2 or 3 tags) where one filter might need to have an \"or\" value.\n\nThanks!"

(chat and memory for a chatbot. Chat over your data & memory  with one chatbot for each dataset). \nSo each query as well as indexing operation for adding new vectors will only apply to one isolated dataset. I will never query all datasets, so all datasets are isolated.\n\nQuestions:\n- In the docs its says, only use collections if you have limited amount of users. How much is limited? For me it will be a couple hundred to thousands\n- there is a mention that collections create an overhead and thate one needs to ensure that they do not affect each other in any way, including performance-wise. What does that mean? Can I use a couple thousand collections if they are all isolated, or is that a no go because the overhead would kill the performance?\n\n- for using partition by payload to optimize performance it is adviced to set\n\n    \"hnsw_config\": {\n        \"payload_m\": 16,\n        \"m\": 0\n    }\n\nI am trying to understand these, settings, the explenation in the docs is rather short.\n\nits says: \"By adopting this strategy, Qdrant will index vectors for each user independently, significantly accelerating the process.\"\n\nIn my limited understanding m:0  limits the number of nodes neighbors nodes to 0, so this wont build a global graph as there are no neighbors nodes.\n\npayload_m:\nCustom M param for additional payload-aware HNSW links. If not set, default M will be used.\nWhat are  payload-aware HNSW links? A payload index created with \n\n{\n    \"field_name\": \"group_id\",\n    \"field_schema\": \"keyword\"\n}\n\nwould normaly build an index for that field_name. But the docs suggest that this now builds a separate index for each value of the field_name\nso one separate index for user_1, user_2,....etc.\nis that correct?"

I understand the API usage of updating with \"set_payload\", but this would currently overwrite existing letters for a given point, correct?\n\nLets say I have one point with 3 letters. One of the letter's html_body is updated and must be updated in Qdrant. How can I make an api call that only updates that letter's (based of the id) html_body?\n\nI have seen in the documents of \"set_payload\" that it is possible to update nested structures, but the example is not super clear to me and I wonder if someone can confirm if it can work for my case? \n\nE.g.\n\n{\n    \"case_id\" : \"1\",\n    \"description\": \"Some text\",\n    \"description_embedding\": [...],\n    \"party_id\" : \"1\",\n    \"outcome\" : \"Win\"\n    \"letters\" : [\n         {\n            \"id\" : \"1\",\n             \"html_body\": \"Some body 1\",\n                 \"case_id\" : \"1\"\n         },\n         {\n            \"id\": \"2\",\n            \"html_body\": \"Some body 2\" (only update this html_body, based on matching with id)\n            \"case_id\": \"1\"\n         },\n        ]\n}"

Here are some context:\n- We are using qdrant on a single machine (16vcpu and 120Go of ram)\n- We are working on a single collection (today it is 40Millions points)\n- The payload of our points look like this: (a lot of points share the same content_id)\n```\n{\n    array_ids: string[];\n    content_id: string;\n    type: string;\n}\n```\n- The configuration of our collection: I will put it on the first message because of free discord limitation\n\nWe do a first grpc search request to get a specific content_id, then we do a second grpc batch request with a filter on content_id so we retrieve only vectors on a single content. Lately we found traces of second calls that returned no points but with a first call. I will describe the interaction:\n- A user created the 24/10 x vectors with the content_id: 13\n- The first query returned a point with the content_id: 13, so we went on the second query with filter on content_id: 13 and the searchBatch array was empty\n- Last night at 21H44 and for more thant 10mins each time he queried he only got empty response (empty array) on the batchPart but still got points on the first query\n- Today I logged on and tried the exact same query (re-used the vector values of the failed one) on qdrant dashboard and got all the response as normal behavior\n\nWe are sure that absolutly nothing happened on qdrant (no update on the points, no change of payload, nothing) so we are completely at a loss on this error that seems to appear randomly.\n\nI know that the database was never optimised, so I wanted to check if it may be because the database is under a lot of stress ? \n(not enough shards, a wrong HNSW config, optimization threads low, implement cluster mode)"

We measured the rps. And we found that for binary quantization we reached 550 rps (50% latency 59 ms) while for scalar quantization we reached 1800 rps (50% latency 7 ms). Why did scalar quantization outperformed binary quantization by this much? One caveat is that we do have filter condition set but we created the same payload index for those filter in both collection.

    "messages": "Hello guys, long term user here was there since the begining after a migration from pinecone 1 year ago ! We went a long way with qdrant and using most of its capacity. Today I am strugling with some optimizations:\nThe solution we are implementing avoid duplication of vectors by setting a payload of ids to each vector, since this day we had hundreds to couple thousands documents each representing 10 to 30 vectors. As the number of client keep growing, I am facing today a batch update of 5M of vectors in one time ! batching it document by document would take 9H, I reduced this time by batching 1000 per 1000 but the time is still very long. This is  only a part of the whole process and I wanted to launch it on the early stage so that other unrelated things can be treated while Qdrant finish its operation. We got the very nice wait: false and I gathered all the operationIds from those batch and I wanted at the end of the process to circle on them every 5s to wait for the final completion. But nower in the api in rest or grpc can I found an endpoint that takes a operation id and give back the current status.. Am I missing something obvious ? Am I condemned to the loooooong wait: true to be sure that my payload is updated ?"

The results are 1.1m embeddings.\nWe already filtered with having a Llama 3.1 look at all the data and giving us a score on how useful the texts are.\n\nAs embedding model I use BAAI/bge-m3 with 1024 dimension.\n\nI started with using a FAISS Database with LangChain as a wrapper. Which was working great. It was  really fast. The generated database file with metadata and texts was around  10gb.\nWe tried to implement filtering by metadata which FAISS did not really support. So we looked for alternatives.\n\nNow I am working with Qdrant on a small scale. everything was fine. But with a big full database (sqlite file around 15gb) the loadtime alone was 10 minutes with the default settings.\nI am currently trying to load all documents. With FAISS, I loaded everything, filtered and paginated the results manually and it took seconds. With client.scroll with the qdrant DB. It takes minutes.\nIs there an easy way to just get all texts with metadata from the vector_store?\n\nThis is how my code currently looks:\n```python\n# Use scroll method to retrieve all documents\n    all_docs = []\n    scroll_id = None\n    total_loaded = 0\n\n    while True:\n        logger.debug(f\"Loading documents with scroll_id={scroll_id}.
