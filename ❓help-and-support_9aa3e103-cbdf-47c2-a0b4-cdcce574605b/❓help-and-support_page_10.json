Do you have any advice as to how I can avoid failed writes/lost data while my cluster restarts?\n\nI have explored creating a new cluster with the latest software version and migrating to it but my collection is large enough that using the Python library's migrate() function fails after several hours due to connectivity issues (timeouts or 502 errors) with no option to resume.\n\nAnother option I have explored is temporarily diverting my prod system to a fresh cluster cluster to capture new writes then changing back to the original cluster and backfilling the vectors from the new cluster after the update finishes.

Index info is there. \nSo I was getting same result initially, but latter noticed there is indeed some difference in filtered-search and vector search. But that difference is too little.\n\nAlso, on some instance I get filtered search results that have lower scored entries than vector search. I have an understanding why this might be the case.  \n\nFiltering is to filter out collections of documents on which the vector search will take place. So when we filter for some keywords qdrant looks for the presence of at least one keyword in the documents. So the search space is narrowed down for following vector search. I believe this is the reason we get some search results where the score is lower in search-with-filters than plain vector search. As some document may not contain exact keyword but are semantically more related to the query.

I want to make sure that we don't disrupt or slow the read processes by writing new data.   When a new vector and payload is added  the index will be rebuilt.  By default will this cause any latency or outage issues on the production reads?  Is there a way to stop that happening?

Before I encountered the same problem but earlier. I searcht the discord and found a page that referred to the tutorial about bulk upload: https://qdrant.tech/documentation/tutorials/bulk-upload/. I followed the instructions in  the tutorial. I have now created the collection like this:\n```client.create_collection(\n    collection_name=\"test_collection\",\n    vectors_config=VectorParams(size=20, \n                                distance=Distance.DOT, \n                                on_disk=True))\n\nclient.create_payload_index(collection_name='test_collection', \n                            field_name='doc_id', \n                            field_schema='integer')\nclient.update_collection(\n    collection_name=\"test_collection\",\n    optimizer_config=models.OptimizersConfigDiff(indexing_threshold=0,\n                                                  memmap_threshold=None),\n    \n)````\nIf I understand this correctly all the points should be placed on disk, no indexing should take place untill i up the threshold again, and also no power is lost on the memmap. There is plenty of storage left on the device. Therefore i dont understand why the service is having problems.\n\nAlso, once the service is killed during upload, I cannot restart the service anymore. It gives a similar error while loading the collection\n```INFO storage::content_manager::toc: Loading collection: test_collection\n./entrypoint.sh: line 25:     7 Killed                  ./qdrant $@ ```\n\nDoes anybody know what I am doing wrong?","timestamp":"2023-11-09T15:43:20.712000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-09T15:44:10.473000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://qdrant.tech/documentation/tutorials/bulk-upload/","title":"Bulk Upload Vectors - Qdrant","description":"Qdrant is an Open-Source Vector Database and Vector Search Engine written in Rust.

have just started with Qdrant. In my usecase I need exact scores for a set of vectors compared to a filtered subset of my database of vectors. Therefore I was interested in the scroll method to return all vectors that pass a certain condition, and then compare them outside qdrant. However, then I found that using the same filter, and with exact set to True in the SearchParams, the operation time decreases. See my test results when comparing 1 vector to query_size in the picture. \n\nhow can this happen? In both operations, qdrant would need to go through the collection and filter the payload and retrieve those embeddings, but in the search version, it would stil need to do a dot product (i believe even without GPU)\n\nSome info about setup:\nQdrant via docker daemon\npython client\nApple macbook air M2\n\nCollection info:\n6.5 million vectors of size 20\nAll points have a payload of doc_id: int\nAbout 1.3 million unique doc_ids, each doc has 1-10 (avg 5) points associated with it\nSimilarity measure: dot_product\n\nFilter\n```models.Filter(\n        must=[\n            models.FieldCondition(\n                key = 'doc_id', match = models.MatchAny(any=query)\n            )\n        ]\n    )\n```\nwhere query is a list of document_ids of length query_size, randomly generated\n\nScroll\n```     output = client.scroll(\n        collection_name='test_collection_3',\n        scroll_filter=f,\n        with_vectors=True,\n        limit = 100000)\n```\nSearch\n```    output = client.search(\n        collection_name='test_collection_3',\n        query_filter=f,\n        query_vector=[0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6],\n        with_vectors=True,\n        search_params=models.SearchParams(exact=True),\n        score_threshold= 7,\n        limit = 100000)\n```\nPlease let me know if you see why this is possible? Am i not performing the scroll in an optimised manner? Or do i fundamentally not understand how qdrant works?

so looks like there was an incident overnight - I wasn't able to recover qdrant until I downgraded from 1.6.1 -> 1.5.1.\n\nGot these logs, memory started spiking and CPU went to 100+ on all pods (see attached image). Does your managed service have safeguards to protect against things like this? This is the second time something disastrous has brought down our entire Qdrant instance (on top of us bringing it down by doing stupid things a bunch of times).\n```\n[2023-10-28T14:35:50.177Z ERROR qdrant::tonic::logging] gRPC /qdrant.PointsInternal/CreateFieldIndex unexpectedly failed with Internal error \"Service internal error: No target shard 2 found for update\" 0.000214\n[2023-10-28T14:35:50.179Z ERROR qdrant::tonic::logging] gRPC /qdrant.PointsInternal/CreateFieldIndex unexpectedly failed with Internal error \"Service internal error: No target shard 2 found for update\" 0.000153\n[2023-10-28T14:35:50.179Z ERROR collection::shards::transfer::shard_transfer] Failed to transfer shard 2 -> 4907887099804696: Service internal error: Internal error: status: Internal, message: \"Service internal error: No target shard 2 found for update\", details: [], metadata: MetadataMap { headers: {\"content-type\": \"application/grpc\", \"date\": \"Sat, 28 Oct 2023 14:35:49 GMT\", \"content-length\": \"0\"} }\n[2023-10-28T14:35:50.179Z WARN  collection::shards::transfer::shard_transfer] Retrying transfer shard 2 -> 4907887099804696 (retry 1)\n```\n\nThe good news is that now I can say that I have performed measurements on 1.5.x!\n\n1. Looks like 1.5.1 is working great, P50 latency ~6ms, everything seems to be in line with 1.4.1.\n2. We have 4 collections getting good utilization (~250 reads and writes per second, split pretty evenly between the 4).\n3. Sure! I've attached the collection configurations for all 4 (pulled from the dashboard). We're constantly reading and writing to all of them & delete vectors after 6hrs to avoid filling memory (we aren't querying very old vectors anwyays).\n\nAs for upgrading db & client versions in lockstep, I tested with client versions 1.1.7 & 1.6.4 and it didn't seem to make a difference (but I also didn't change my code, so it's possible there are more optimized ways of querying/writing in newer client versions?).","timestamp":"2023-11-01T17:08:15.277000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-11-01T17:16:32.491000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"907307031457849344","username":"agourlay","avatar":"a6703decd7c0f8f6a5967c8022f4810c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"agourlay","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[{"id":"1169322021625270392","filename":"Screenshot_2023-11-01_at_10.00.43_AM.png","size":141725,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1169038846709747824/1169322021625270392/Screenshot_2023-11-01_at_10.00.43_AM.png?ex=6635c2be&is=6634713e&hm=ea3522eb2984591ef7f9506d8f78d12b26123df3c04793af48b1959e11471907&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1169038846709747824/1169322021625270392/Screenshot_2023-11-01_at_10.00.43_AM.png?ex=6635c2be&is=6634713e&hm=ea3522eb2984591ef7f9506d8f78d12b26123df3c04793af48b1959e11471907&","width":2094,"height":774,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":1,"placeholder":"/fcBA4CghmxvFoamnp6AKAw=","placeholder_version":1},{"id":"1169322021839196301","filename":"cfg1.json","size":1332,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1169038846709747824/1169322021839196301/cfg1.json?ex=6635c2be&is=6634713e&hm=960942315305c1e0d424ca2aef414f4befd7da1a32bf0f255a7aa932286df3df&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1169038846709747824/1169322021839196301/cfg1.json?ex=6635c2be&is=6634713e&hm=960942315305c1e0d424ca2aef414f4befd7da1a32bf0f255a7aa932286df3df&","content_type":"application/json;

First of all, thanks for building a great product! I've been very impressed with performance and ease of use.\n\nI'm playing around with self-hosted Qdrant in a k8s cluster (16 replicas, handling ~250 reads & writes per second), and just went ahead with an upgrade from 1.4.1 -> 1.6.1, but noticed pretty a considerable increase in search latency (round trip), P50 latency from ~6ms -> 27ms.\n\nI also noticed the memory utilization dropped quite a bit while CPU utilization increased considerably.\n\nI've attached some metrics we're sending to datadog so you can see how the upgrade affected our instance.\n\nWe also upgraded the helm chart version from 0.2.8 -> 0.6.1, but are still using Python client version 1.1.7 for requests.\n\nI'd love to understand:\n1. Why memory utilization dropped & CPU increased because of the upgrade (was payload pushed entirely to PVs?)\n2. What might've changed in this upgrade that could cause this latency increase - do we need to upgrade our Python client version or change how we're querying the database?\n\nOne other potential relevant piece of information is that we're running several collections that use payload indexing on the same cluster (for isolation and simplicity).

Grouping and returning in some custom json payload\n\nI asked a similar question a couple weeks back linked here but that was a bit more customized. https://discord.com/channels/907569970500743200/1163335538271596654/1163850403843166259 I'm not sure if the same score threshold or MRR would apply\n\nIn this case i'm specifically wanting to extend the qdrant food discovery demo and hopefully contribute some code.","timestamp":"2023-10-31T11:09:03.366000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"du_has_star"},{"id":"1168869057190182943","channel_id":"1168700696774836224","author":{"id":"283329946661683200","username":"loryruta","avatar":"b8a155e268e5b2ee8f7a5f11bd9e90f0","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"loryruta","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"I was regenerating it every time","timestamp":"2023-10-31T11:08:19.771000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":57,"userName":"loryruta"},{"id":"1168869042648522863","channel_id":"1168700696774836224","author":{"id":"283329946661683200","username":"loryruta","avatar":"b8a155e268e5b2ee8f7a5f11bd9e90f0","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"loryruta","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"oh god","timestamp":"2023-10-31T11:08:16.304000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":56,"userName":"loryruta"},{"id":"1168868942866030612","channel_id":"1168700696774836224","author":{"id":"770974202865385502","username":"kacperlukawski","avatar":"8446b12fe8eb462d62600c9a936a772b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Kacper ≈Åukawski","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"You can check if it exists by calling `get_collection` method","timestamp":"2023-10-31T11:07:52.514000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":55,"userName":"kacperlukawski"},{"id":"1168868812431568906","channel_id":"1168700696774836224","author":{"id":"770974202865385502","username":"kacperlukawski","avatar":"8446b12fe8eb462d62600c9a936a772b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Kacper ≈Åukawski","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Probably the collection is just regenerated.
