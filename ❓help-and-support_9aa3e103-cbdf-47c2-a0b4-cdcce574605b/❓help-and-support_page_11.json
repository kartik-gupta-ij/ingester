I also don't see anything about that in the [API spec](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html#tag/points/operation/search_batch_points).\n\nThe team is interested in running a search **for each vector** and then returning the hits that appear the most. For example, suppose I have 50 text/natural language queries and want to run a search against each 50 of those. Assume each query returns the same item ID for all 50 searches. In that instance I'd want to bubble that result up to the top. If the API supported returning duplicates, then we could count occurence of each id and then bubble those up. However, the result of `search_batch` doesn't seem to return duplicates, It seems to just return `50*k` unique hits.\n\nI can achieve the above by making 50 unique calls, but thats horribly inefficient.

I'll check the github issue.\n\nI think that my use case shouldn't be that infrequent. For example, developers need to group any product and for that they compute a distance. These groups are the data the application displays, but also the user may have the option to search similar products to those already computed groups. In my case, to do the offline processing i use plain dot products for exact similarity, without any type of indexing, but i want the users to have the option to search similar products. Also, i normalize using faiss, which normalize my arrays of embeddings in place so that's why i don't have the original embeddings. \n\nWhat i don't understand is why is complicated to upload the normalized vectors and let qdrant simply compute the cosine similarity between them, in that case still the vectors are being stored normalized, it just that the developer did the normalization, not qdrant.","timestamp":"2023-10-27T22:16:54.684000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-27T22:27:23.670000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"700197412735680563","username":"luis.cossio","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Luis Cossío","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"joseluis7448"},{"id":"1167583474899767357","channel_id":"1167577307255414895","author":{"id":"700197412735680563","username":"luis.cossio","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Luis Cossío","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Hi @null, unfortunately, currently we don't have that feature, storing the normalized vectors was a tradeoff we made for performance.

After some time, I wanted to add a new named vector to the collection. But when I did this, the data of the previous named vector was deleted. I did this with recreate. When I did this with the update collection, I encountered an error that I could not find anything about and did not understand. I need your help on this.

That way I can later simply use the code snippet above (my second post, I think) and delete Qdrant \"points\" by using that same metadata tag.  I just plug in the full file name (with path) that I want to \"purge\", and Qdrant client will handle removing all vectors/points in the collection with that tag value (and in my example above I am also using a second grouping tag value).
