a preface:\n--------------\n- I run Qdrant as a docker image client on a VM\n- I use the langchain integration of qdrant to upsert points (using add_texts)\n- I use a single collection to host all my vector points, where each point has a unique id entry containing: payload information (page metadata, page text content), and vectors of d=1536 dimensions (OpenAIEmbeddings). each point represents a single page of document information, the collection represents all documents in my database.\n- I implement quantization and optimisation configs in my collection params and in my search params (but havent implemented hnsw configs)\n\nWhat I'd like help with:\n-----------------------\n<1> My search results are monotonous. Two different pages from two completely different documents that are entirely unrelated will produce scores that have a difference of  < 0.002, this in turn produces poor and contextually inaccurate search results. What could be responsible for this?\n\n<2> In what ways can I realistically adjust my quantization, optimisation, and hnsw configs? The guides available in the documentation don't go very deep into the relationships between parameters and their effects on the algorithm and its search/store capabilities (aside from disk space and speed, but even then at a shallow level). Any documentation or resource more thorough that I'd be able to refer to?\n\n<3> Does Qdrant have Re-Ranking functionality for search result refinement?\n\nMy goal:\n---------\n- I'd like to be able to run a search request on a vectorstore instance for a collection of document pages and see accurate search results. as it stand, my queries will return inaccurate and irrelevant results very often.\n\nReference:\n-----------\nI've attached a python file containing relevant snippets from my code that: sets up configs, creates the collection if it doesnt exist, creates a vectorStore instance, performs vector

Oh my, the hours I have wasted trying to figure this out!!  泗  That is in NO WAY a criticism of Qdrant or Andrey's attempt to assist me earlier, but rather my own \"thick\" brain!  I have been writing software for 35+ years, but ZERO Python until a few weeks ago.  And definitely no A/I stuff (langchain, vectors, etc.).  So this has been quite the adventure!  Anyway, for anyone (later) that might need this type of metadata filter using Qdrant \"as_retriever()\" in a Python script, here you go: \n\n`from qdrant_client.http import models as qmodels\n\nretriever.search_kwargs = dict(\n        filter=qmodels.Filter(\n            must=[\n                qmodels.FieldCondition(\n                    key=\"metadata.tag1\",\n                    match=qmodels.MatchValue(value=tag1)\n                    ),\n                qmodels.FieldCondition(\n                    key=\"metadata.tag2\",\n                    match=qmodels.MatchAny(any=[tag2, \"$$$\"])\n                )\n            ]\n        )\n    )`\n\nAgain, \"tag1\" (above) is the actual key I included in the \"metadata\" payload when adding my vectors (it is my high-level grouping).  It is ALWAYS set to a specific value, and it must always be included in my search filtering (during a chat).  \"tag2\" is a second \"metadata\" item/key, but in some cases my vectors/points may not have a specific value (basically, they are cross-tag2 or \"global\" points for \"tag2\" filtering).  In the above example, I am using \"$$$\" for the tag2 value to indicate \"global\" (but you could obviously use any text string for this).  So the above filter will give me:\n\n**- All points where metadata.tag1 = {tag1 value} and where metadata.tag2 = {tag2 value OR \"$$$\"}**\nI created a small collection and THOROUGHLY tested all scenarios, and always got the correct responses (based on the tags) -- VERY thankful!\n\nThanks to all (Andrey, etc.) for a great product and quick assistance on these support questions -- much appreciated!","timestamp":"2023-10-02T23:40:25.109000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-10-02T23:59:47.072000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":4,"userName":"ktalley_04405"},{"id":"1158538426086342778","channel_id":"1153398394195288136","author":{"id":"461008380606283781","username":"dtuchainz","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"We're unable to do so via the dashboard","timestamp":"2023-10-02T22:58:05.382000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1158538425843060857","filename":"Screen_Shot_2023-10-02_at_3.57.41_PM.png","size":326957,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1153398394195288136/1158538425843060857/Screen_Shot_2023-10-02_at_3.57.41_PM.png?ex=663614bd&is=6634c33d&hm=a1384c454fb8352e504a0be792fd5399c4bf9301c93ab8f63243193fb6fca07d&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1153398394195288136/1158538425843060857/Screen_Shot_2023-10-02_at_3.57.41_PM.png?ex=663614bd&is=6634c33d&hm=a1384c454fb8352e504a0be792fd5399c4bf9301c93ab8f63243193fb6fca07d&","width":1282,"height":693,"content_type":"image/png"}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":58,"userName":"dtuchainz"},{"id":"1158537886568808478","channel_id":"1153398394195288136","author":{"id":"461008380606283781","username":"dtuchainz","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"also is it possible to enable us to increase the # of nodes?","timestamp":"2023-10-02T22:55:56.751000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"144524348114337792","username":"timvisee","avatar":"c07652e0135d52704221e3d5fd61cdcd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"timvisee","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"channel_id":"1153398394195288136","message_id":"1154715372210098276","guild_id":"907569970500743200"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":19,"channel_id":"1153398394195288136","content":"Scaling to multiple nodes _could_ make performance better, but it is not a magical solution.

We are currently using a topography of one Qdrant collection per high-level grouping, and then using metadata tags (probably 2 or 3 max) to be able to further filter our searches.  If we had a metadata tag with a key name of \"tag2\", let us say that some items might have that populated with a specific value (\"123\", \"456\", etc.), but others might have a value of \"$$$\" to indicate a global item (which should be searched/included for all \"tag2\" values).  Then we need to also include another metadata tag/filter (i.e. \"tag1\") on top of that.\n\nMy trouble/issue seems to be around how to properly construct my Langchain retriever to do such a search -- basically I want to set my retriever filter to be something like:\n\n`where \"tag1\" = \"{some-value}\" AND where (\"tag2\" = \"{some-tag2-value}\" OR \"tag2\" = \"$$$\")`\n\nI found one example on the internet that showed the following approach, but it definitely is not working as expected:\n\n`retriever.search_kwargs = dict(\n    filter=qdrant_models.Filter(\n        must=[\n            qdrant_models.FieldCondition(\n                key=\"tag1\",\n                match=qdrant_models.MatchValue(value=\"abc\")\n            ),\n            qdrant_models.FieldCondition(\n                key=\"tag2\",\n                match=qdrant_models.MatchAny(any=[\"$$$\", \"123\"])\n            )\n        ]\n    )\n)`\n\nHopefully that makes sense -- I am basically needing compound metadata filtering (using 2 or 3 tags) where one filter might need to have an \"or\" value.\n\nThanks!","timestamp":"2023-09-29T17:06:18.602000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-09-29T17:11:37.482000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"ktalley_04405"},{"id":"1157362729171038268","channel_id":"1157160099354247188","author":{"id":"317332947579568129","username":"skeptrune","avatar":"2940928c95830ead494a220831b746b6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"skeptrune - trieve.ai","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"We are running it on a remote machine through Docker","timestamp":"2023-09-29T17:06:17.394000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"144524348114337792","username":"timvisee","avatar":"c07652e0135d52704221e3d5fd61cdcd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"timvisee","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"channel_id":"1157160099354247188","message_id":"1157218312464388136","guild_id":"907569970500743200"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1157160099354247188","content":"Are you using local mode in Python by any chance?
