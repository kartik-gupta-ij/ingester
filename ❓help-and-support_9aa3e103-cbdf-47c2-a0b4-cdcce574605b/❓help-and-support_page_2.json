However, when I add sparse vectors without quantization into the mix, the RAM cost for this hybrid setup increases by more than 5 times.\n\nWe've noticed that sparse vector indexing with `on_disk: true` is quite slow, but upgrading to larger machines is too costly.

short use case question:\nWe have a multi-tenant system which requires strong isolation, no downtime and optimize for cost efficieny. Tenants are everything but equally sized. Embedding models may be diverse but searches will be local to one embedding model.\n\nForm the docs I think a multi-node, single collection per embedding model setup is advised. We should then build a payload index over a tenant_id. Tenants will often have below 100k relevant dense vectors per search.\n\n**Now: We need to support multiple versions of VectorStores. In the common case, a set of vectors is extended by a small set of additions, deletions.** The customer needs to query both only the old version as well as only the new version. The trivial implementation would assign a versions: [] array string/int field to every Point and perform a MATCH ANY version_8978 clause in every search. \n-> Is this the best configuration for our use case? \n-> Are there known performance penalties for such a set membership pre-filtering?\n-> Do you have a better idea about how to encode versions?

My main question is whether I need to explicitly create indexes for each nested key when I already have an index on the root `group_id`. Will the existing root index automatically apply to all nested fields, or is it necessary to create separate indexes for each one?     With the current approach that I'm using, if I'm correct, I  need to create an index for each new filter key. And here is a quite tricky moment: I'm not always 100% sure if the new filter is really new. I'm concerned about accidentally creating duplicate indexes for the same keys.

I have now separated out the vector embedding / processing to the database upload process.\nI am still facing RAM issues as the data scales up, despite having tried to set everything to on_disk where possible to limit RAM usage.\n\nI set payload = on_disk, dense_vector = on_disk and hnsw_index = on_disk. I am using dense and sparse vectors with payloads.\n\nMy python code for creating the collections is as follows:\n\nclient.create_collection(\n            collection_name=collection_name,\n            vectors_config={\n                \"dense\": models.VectorParams(\n                    size=384,\n                    distance=models.Distance.COSINE,\n                    on_disk=True,\n                )\n            },\n            sparse_vectors_config={\n                \"sparse\": models.SparseVectorParams(),\n            },\n            optimizers_config=models.OptimizersConfigDiff(memmap_threshold=10000),\n            on_disk_payload=True,\n            hnsw_config=models.HnswConfigDiff(on_disk=True),\n        )\n\nI am running this in a docker container and despite everything being set to 'on_disk', the RAM usage kept increasing with the amount of points until it exceeded the capacity of my hardware and becomes unresponsive. Then following instructions I saw on the github, I put a strict limit onto the docker container (nominal 4GB value for testing purposes) and tried to run it again. The points are uploaded until this docker container becomes full, then the upserting requests start to time out and Qdrant becomes unresponsive. Eventually, it then seems to crash entirely.\n\nCan you please clarify, if everything is working as intended, should it be technically possible to upload a large dataset of points (say 100M points) in a Qdrant docker container with a small RAM limit of say 4GB? Or does this use case absolutely require large scale hardware (i.e., TBs of RAM)?\n\nAny help would be much appreciated, thank you 🙂","timestamp":"2024-04-10T07:34:11.980000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-10T07:35:25.216000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":9,"userName":"baboon4270"},{"id":"1227519776562352150","channel_id":"1227517848264511499","author":{"id":"1207626283899691009","username":"samir_80452","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Samir @Qdrant","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"something like this: https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/points/#retrieve-points ?","timestamp":"2024-04-10T07:25:20.947000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/points/","title":"Points - Qdrant","description":"Qdrant is an Open-Source Vector Database and Vector Search Engine written in Rust.

However, I would like it to search within the vector that I send to the data. If a result is found there, it should display what's in the payload. This is where I'm stuck. If you have any guidance, what would be the next step? Do I need fastembed, or should I proceed with a normal collection? How do I search within the vector and not just the \"document\"?\n\nI have the code in python on Github, https://github.com/lvalics/Django-SearchEngine\n\n{\n    \"id_value\": 1820,\n    \"id_key\": \"companyID\",\n    \"id_value2\": \"company\",\n    \"id_key2\": \"type\",\n    \"collection_name\": \"1_SearchEngineGP\",\n    \"payload\": {\n        \"companyID\": 1820,\n        \"document\": \"Insert fastembed code here to describe in a concise manner.\",\n        \"name\": \"Company X\",\n        \"address\": \"Address\",\n        \"url\": \"Website\",\n        \"description\": \"Short description\",\n        \"publicContactPhone\": \"0257-555-555\",\n        \"category\": \"Cosmetics\",\n        \"type\": \"company\",\n        \"etc\": \"Additional data for easier display.\"\n    },\n    \"data\": \"Extensive company information spanning 20-30 pages, including all data from the payload, comprehensive description, products, document details, etc., in an unstructured format.\"\n}","timestamp":"2024-04-10T07:17:41.205000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://github.com/lvalics/Django-SearchEngine","title":"GitHub - lvalics/Django-SearchEngine","description":"Contribute to lvalics/Django-SearchEngine development by creating an account on GitHub.","color":1975079,"provider":{"name":"GitHub"},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/a29ce1aeccfeade292e9d70ae4b0a49cd936b317d70905ac93b408720845df84/lvalics/Django-SearchEngine","proxy_url":"https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/w7OIQRYSO0IC_a2cPVmhbGuQgTwsmNXUAxj638SmuvA/https/opengraph.githubassets.com/a29ce1aeccfeade292e9d70ae4b0a49cd936b317d70905ac93b408720845df84/lvalics/Django-SearchEngine","width":1200,"height":600,"placeholder":"+gcKDIJLmbWXhmlmeV9OvSD8NA==","placeholder_version":1},"content_scan_version":1}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"ratamahatta_l"},{"id":"1227515723585294356","channel_id":"1227089302207467520","author":{"id":"1207626283899691009","username":"samir_80452","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Samir @Qdrant","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Congrats","timestamp":"2024-04-10T07:09:14.642000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":32,"userName":"samir_80452"},{"id":"1227423360527630469","channel_id":"1226942235400999045","author":{"id":"1222450825486405674","username":"dmwaura","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"David","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"The collection had over 20M points distributed over 63 nodes each point with 1280 dimensions.

(※I've also confirmed that decreasing docker `--memory` to `32g` actually causes OOM, while `48g` is safe.)\n\nAccording to this [formula](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/capacity-sizing/?q=formula#basic-configuration), the memory calculation would be as follows.\n\nWithout quantization: 9000000 * 768 * 4 * 1.5 ≒ **41GB**\nWith quantization: 9000000 * 768 * 1 * 1.5 ≒ **10GB**\n\nSo the current memory consumption seems to be the original vectors, not quantized ones.\nIs this normal? Please let me know if there is something wrong with my understanding.\n\n(※I'll attach the telemetry and current collection setting.)","timestamp":"2024-04-05T08:36:25.773000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"907307031457849344","username":"agourlay","avatar":"a6703decd7c0f8f6a5967c8022f4810c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"agourlay","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},{"id":"1207626283899691009","username":"samir_80452","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Samir @Qdrant","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},{"id":"844295650400534599","username":"andrey.vasnetsov","avatar":"79926befe1322d1155b0723e0aeb5fab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"andrey.vasnetsov","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[{"id":"1225725725521350666","filename":"image.png","size":15956,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1224989631842488340/1225725725521350666/image.png?ex=6635f389&is=6634a209&hm=13d456daa1564e57e3c26b35dd3109a7658cc88bdd68930b50ab89e32b3ad23e&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1224989631842488340/1225725725521350666/image.png?ex=6635f389&is=6634a209&hm=13d456daa1564e57e3c26b35dd3109a7658cc88bdd68930b50ab89e32b3ad23e&","width":520,"height":118,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":1,"placeholder":"zgcGEoiHeYmPZ7d4lpx/CGg=","placeholder_version":1},{"id":"1225725725714419783","filename":"telemetry.json","size":82951,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1224989631842488340/1225725725714419783/telemetry.json?ex=6635f389&is=6634a209&hm=c6c7b3bd005f05e46812eb98d79903ebab6392d0fc277f91034c3820f76ec541&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1224989631842488340/1225725725714419783/telemetry.json?ex=6635f389&is=6634a209&hm=c6c7b3bd005f05e46812eb98d79903ebab6392d0fc277f91034c3820f76ec541&","content_type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","content_scan_version":1},{"id":"1225725726024663142","filename":"collection.json","size":1470,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1224989631842488340/1225725726024663142/collection.json?ex=6635f389&is=6634a209&hm=b7c5510de7130f9f799abf5df71c24d3c1a98ea004707f01b230d2e1d525e525&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1224989631842488340/1225725726024663142/collection.json?ex=6635f389&is=6634a209&hm=b7c5510de7130f9f799abf5df71c24d3c1a98ea004707f01b230d2e1d525e525&","content_type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","content_scan_version":1}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":4,"components":[],"position":71,"userName":"stmk_mzt"},{"id":"1225714811321454664","channel_id":"1225515778837712916","author":{"id":"770974202865385502","username":"kacperlukawski","avatar":"8446b12fe8eb462d62600c9a936a772b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Kacper Łukawski","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Hey @null 👋 You definitely need an embedding model and the LLM! However, I'm unsure about both vector and key/value stores. I'd advise using just the vector store, as the whole purpose of the semantic cache is not to act as an exact cache, like KV, but when a new query is similar enough to one of the past ones.\n\nThe typical workflow of the semantic search goes as follows:\n1. The user sends a query\n2. Query gets vectorized\n3. The created vector is used to find the most similar past query in our vector store\n4. If the similarity of the most similar past query is acceptable (probably some thresholding, but that's the tricky part), we extract the past response from the payload and return it\n5. Whenever the similarity is too low, we send the query to LLM and cache its response.\n\nSo, to answer your questions - you should utilize Qdrant payloads to keep the LLM response. Adding another component into the stack is not required, and there are no strict limits for payloads. At least handling a single LLM response won't be a big deal.","timestamp":"2024-04-05T07:53:03.699000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-05T07:56:01.532000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"456226577798135808","username":"Deleted User","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0000","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"kacperlukawski"},{"id":"1225707812500406353","channel_id":"1225480019552239626","author":{"id":"144524348114337792","username":"timvisee","avatar":"c07652e0135d52704221e3d5fd61cdcd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"timvisee","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Or, if you're storing point ID mappings elsewhere, maybe you can update that instead.","timestamp":"2024-04-05T07:25:15.050000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":4,"userName":"timvisee"},{"id":"1225707723497406464","channel_id":"1225480019552239626","author":{"id":"144524348114337792","username":"timvisee","avatar":"c07652e0135d52704221e3d5fd61cdcd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"timvisee","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"An other way of doing it is probably to scroll over the collection and insert each one again with your new ID, if they are not overlapping.","timestamp":"2024-04-05T07:24:53.830000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":3,"userName":"timvisee"},{"id":"1225707136722407465","channel_id":"1221863648884953098","author":{"id":"144524348114337792","username":"timvisee","avatar":"c07652e0135d52704221e3d5fd61cdcd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"timvisee","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"I'll likely be part of Qdrant 1.10 though.","timestamp":"2024-04-05T07:22:33.932000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":13,"userName":"timvisee"},{"id":"1225707083572183111","channel_id":"1221863648884953098","author":{"id":"144524348114337792","username":"timvisee","avatar":"c07652e0135d52704221e3d5fd61cdcd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"timvisee","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"We don't have a public issue for it at this time.","timestamp":"2024-04-05T07:22:21.260000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":12,"userName":"timvisee"},{"id":"1225705780385288222","channel_id":"1225629973188972655","author":{"id":"879983268500488202","username":"mikheili","avatar":"c3ea785b80c3008b346891ee076b705c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Mikheil","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"To get a clearer idea for the pricing structure, please use our Billing Calculator - https://cloud.qdrant.io/calculator","timestamp":"2024-04-05T07:17:10.556000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"link","url":"https://cloud.qdrant.io/calculator","title":"Vector Search Database | Qdrant Cloud","description":"Managed cloud solution of the Qdrant vector search engine.

When creating a shard, we specify a replication factor of 2 as follows:\n\n_, err := p.collectionsClient.CreateShardKey(ctx, &pb.CreateShardKeyRequest{\n        CollectionName: collectionName,\n            Request: &pb.CreateShardKey{\n                ShardKey: &pb.ShardKey{\n                    Key: &pb.ShardKey_Keyword{Keyword: <uuid>},\n                },\n                ReplicationFactor: 2\n            },\n        })\n\nHowever, when any qdrant node is reassigned by kubernetes, the cluster temporarily becomes unavailable. When upserting points, I get a lot of errors like the one below:\n\nrpc error: code = Internal desc = Service internal error: Tonic status error: status: Unavailable, message: \"Failed to connect to http://qdrant-52.qdrant-headless:6335/, error: transport error\", details: [], metadata: MetadataMap { headers: {} }\n\nAssuming the shard was replicated, I'd expect the write to succeed accessing the available shard? I use ordering WEAK on upserts and set wait to false\n\nIt sometimes takes ~30min for the node to finish recovery and start serving. There are currently no deletes in the collection,  only upsert traffic with sporadic search requests for testing.\n\n1. Is there a requirement for all nodes (peers) to be available? How can we leverage replication to avoid getting these errors?\n\n2. How can I confirm that the shards in the cluster are replicated? What endpoint can I use to get the per shard replication state, and confirm that created custom shards are actually replicated?\n\nThank you!","timestamp":"2024-04-03T17:32:07.519000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"dmwaura"},{"id":"1225108820171165821","channel_id":"1225038144819167273","author":{"id":"664117455286829067","username":"hieunm21","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"hieunm21","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"I'm not using the payload index yet.
