Thanks for the detailed response! \n\nIs there anything on the roadmap for user named snapshots? \n\nI think this would be really helpful since snapshots have to be taken of each node. Especially since a statefulset is being used in the Helm chart. When setting a separate volume  that is outside of the cluster (fileshare in my example) for snapshots , you are unable to set the sts to have a separate snapshot path for each node.\n\n So the stateful set has each pod use the same snapshot path so snapshots all show up in the same folder in the fileshare.\n\n If I was able to name the snapshot when I take it, it would be much easier to discern what node the snapshot came from. I do see that the node id is added to the snapshot name, but not every user has access to that information. If we were able to give a meaningful name, such as adding the pod name with statefulset ordinal, it would be really helpful.\n\nThanks again and I appreciate your time!","timestamp":"2024-03-30T03:37:47.988000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":9,"userName":"lie5419"},{"id":"1223410461236793384","channel_id":"1210134320606478366","author":{"id":"750003279542485026","username":"anandvamsi","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Anand Vamsi","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"okay, thanks.

Yes on performance and does it impact ingestion of data. (as in does it lock writes etc during a snapshot)\nIn Qdrant 1.8 there may be a small performance hit for updates when a snapshot is being made.\nWe're actively working on improving this to make snapshotting transparent though.\nYou can follow some of this develoment process here: https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/pull/3420\n\n> 7. Can snapshot creation happen at the same time as deletion?\nIn Qdrant 1.8, no. In a later version: probably. See the above PR.\n\n> 8. In the snapshots section of a collection in the Qdrant dashboard, the snapshots that are available seem to alternate between snapshots on each node when the browser page is refreshed. Is this the expected way to view all snapshots on all nodes when viewing the dashboard?\nNo, it only shows the snapshots of the current node.\nIf you're accessing multiple nodes randomly through a loadbalancer (which is the case on Qdrant Cloud) you might see snapshots of a different node each time.","timestamp":"2024-03-29T08:40:33.465000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":4,"components":[],"position":8,"userName":"timvisee"},{"id":"1223190044345499668","channel_id":"1222362785023791185","author":{"id":"144524348114337792","username":"timvisee","avatar":"c07652e0135d52704221e3d5fd61cdcd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"timvisee","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"> 1. Does Qdrant have the ability for users to name the snapshot that is created?\nNo. Though once you download the file, you can give it any name you want.\n\n> 2. How does  Qdrant suggest snapshots be set up in an Azure cloud environment? Separate volume for snapshots, use blob storage, file share etc.\nAll should be fine. But the same volume is usually used. A file share may also be useful here.\nNote that a file share cannot be used for the storage data of Qdrant. But for storing snapshots it should be fine.\n\n> 3. It seems that Qdrant only has the ability create snapshots to the local file system or a drive/fileshare I attach. Is there anything available that will automatically send snapshots to cloud storage?\nIt will not. You can configure a snapshot path in the configuration (`config.yaml`).\n\n> 4. I do see the snapshot when listing, but is there a snapshot status field that I can monitor during the actual snapshot? In Elasticsearch for example, their snapshots have a status field that returns \"In progress\" during the snapshot, and then returns \"Success\" once its complete. Does Qdrant have anything like that?\nWe don't show the process of individual snapshots when listing them. They'll only be listed there if they are done creating.\n\nBut, you can set `wait=true` when creating a snapshot. Then, the creation request will wait and only return once the process it done. The response contains the snapshot details.\nSee: https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html#tag/collections/operation/create_snapshot\n\n> 5. Does the snapshot in the snapshots folder only show up once the snapshot has completed?\nYes.","timestamp":"2024-03-29T08:40:32.344000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":7,"userName":"timvisee"},{"id":"1223188995748663299","channel_id":"1223105029506990121","author":{"id":"1022436748250316811","username":"wtlyu","avatar":"e32a7b47768befbc3405972bbc8ff1df","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"wtlyu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"thank you!","timestamp":"2024-03-29T08:36:22.339000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":38,"userName":"wtlyu"},{"id":"1223188960168378388","channel_id":"1223105029506990121","author":{"id":"1022436748250316811","username":"wtlyu","avatar":"e32a7b47768befbc3405972bbc8ff1df","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"wtlyu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Oh that index fix my issue","timestamp":"2024-03-29T08:36:13.856000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":37,"userName":"wtlyu"},{"id":"1223188276777844767","channel_id":"1223105029506990121","author":{"id":"1022436748250316811","username":"wtlyu","avatar":"e32a7b47768befbc3405972bbc8ff1df","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"wtlyu","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"I'm curious why there need to 'replay' the delete operation?

all,\n\nI am developing a system using langchain. It runs on a 64GB RAM 16 core machine with 16TB of flash mass storage, so a swap file is not an option, there is also a Tesla P40, but I don't think it matters because running everything on the CPU has the same results (although things like embedding get much slower).\nThe OS is Ubuntu Linux 22.04. All the python dependencies are in a Python 3.10 venv with dependencies themselves installed via pip.\n\nThe initial tests were okay, but now that the database is being filled, the RAM requirements are out of scale. The current database is around 1M points, 1024 bit embedding vector, the on disk size is 10.4GB, and was created with swap enabled by mistake, the used swap was around 40GB. Trying to just load that database without any swap result in the process killed by the OS because of an out of memory error.\n\nThe final size of the database is expected to be in the order of 100M points.\n\nThe database was created and updated using a tool, this edited bit is the one that pushes documents into the database:\n\nfor element in pdf_list:\n\n      filename = element[0]\n      loader = PyPDFLoader(filename)\n      docs = loader.load_and_split(splitter)\n\n      if None == qdrant:\n          # not initialized yet, do it now\n          texts = []\n          metas = []\n

thanks for the quick response!\n@samir_80452 \nTo be more succinct on my questions:\n1. Does Qdrant have the ability for users to name the snapshot that is created?\n2. How does  Qdrant suggest snapshots be set up in an Azure cloud environment? Separate volume for snapshots, use blob storage, file share etc.\n3. It seems that Qdrant only has the ability create snapshots to the local file system or a drive/fileshare I attach. Is there anything available that will automatically send snapshots to cloud storage?\n4. I do see the snapshot when listing, but is there a snapshot status field that I can monitor during the actual snapshot? In Elasticsearch for example, their snapshots have a status field that returns \"In progress\" during the snapshot, and then returns \"Success\" once its complete. Does Qdrant have anything like that?\n5. Yes, this seems to be what I am seeing.\n6. Yes on performance and does it impact ingestion of data. (as in does it lock writes etc during a snapshot)\n7. Either data/collection\n8. In the UI, you can click into collections and then snapshots of that collection. When viewing this page, it seems that you only see snapshots of a single node. Once you refresh the page, you see a different set of snapshots that are on another node. So I am thinking that the UI only takes into account single node deployments and not multinode. Its a little confusing since you dont see all snapshots of all nodes at one time. You also dont have any indication what node you are viewing snapshots from. I csan see a situation where someone may run a snapshot from this page and only snapshot 1 node and not all.\n\nFinally, on a multinode cluster when getting snapshots via curl for a particular collection, the endpoint returns the snapshots of each node depending on which node it hits. Is this expected? I do have ingress into my k8s cluster behind an nginx ingress contoller loadbalncer. \n\nI hope this clears up and confusion on my questions!\n\nThanks again for your time!","timestamp":"2024-03-27T13:52:08.240000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-03-27T15:50:59.440000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"1207626283899691009","username":"samir_80452","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Samir @Qdrant","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"lie5419"},{"id":"1222536694348124252","channel_id":"1222420715219849308","author":{"id":"932266934681108491","username":"captaindk_950","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"CaptainDK950","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"These are two places we are checking for the payload index in the collection","timestamp":"2024-03-27T13:24:21.566000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"captaindk_950"},{"id":"1222536571107147806","channel_id":"1222420715219849308","author":{"id":"932266934681108491","username":"captaindk_950","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"CaptainDK950","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"In our platform, we regularly train our bots.

I would suggest to keep it simple: leave only one language, e.g. english, if you have it, and work with it.\n\nI would probably start with joining columns into a string, maybe augmenting it like \"Title: {title}, brand: {brand}, color: {color}\". However, I am not sure about viability of this approach, because vector search might not handle the conditions that good. (You might want to try out hybrid search here (dense vectors + sparse vectors), and use SPLADE models (be careful with the licence and find the proper model, e.g. you can use fastembed for it). It seems like you have some requirements from the client, maybe you could use payload filters as well? So, users could click some checkboxes (e.g. to choose brand) and then write their queries.\n\nAs you said, you would not be able to set  different weights to different characteristics of the item (like category or color). Moreover, Qdrant does not have such a functionality even for multiple vectors and if you really want it, you will need to implement it on your side.\n\nBtw, if you want to add these weights, how would you assign the weights? Which characteristic are more important?\n\nRegarding query-tokenization: you can try it out and combine with filtering by payload, however I am not sure how good it will work. It can both work and not, e.g. it depends on what a typical query look like, how you would handle mistakes in queries, etc.\n\nRegarding the collection size:\nQdrant easily handles 1M points and does not require a lot of resources for it.","timestamp":"2024-03-25T14:50:55.404000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jmzzomg"},{"id":"1221831053862371398","channel_id":"1221818766397145128","author":{"id":"684815761814192147","username":"alexsjg","avatar":"75aed42ec7414e4b59ab69440ea1cfdd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"We want to test how quantization on the collection impacts the quality of our application.
