For HTTP clients it works fine. For gRPC, I just used a generic exception handler `except Exception  as exc` instead of the above, and that able to handle the exception.

In the optimising performance section it mentions running:\n```\nPUT /collections/{collection_name}\n{\n    \"vectors\": {\n      \"size\": 768,\n      \"distance\": \"Cosine\"\n    },\n    \"hnsw_config\": {\n        \"payload_m\": 16,\n        \"m\": 0\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf the collection already exists, you can not set the vector size nor distance, even with a PATCH.  Does this matter for multi-tenancy? I dont believe it matters at all. The HNSW config gets accepted which is fine. \n\n2. Same context as above, does setting the HNSW config on a collection that has existing docs/payloads remove the global index right away?\n\n3. The docs then state to specify the group_id as being the field you wish to index on:\n```\nPUT /collections/{collection_name}/index\n{\n    \"field_name\": \"group_id\",\n    \"field_schema\": \"keyword\"\n}\n```\n\nAs this is a PUT, does this automatically create the index and generate it once run or do we need to run a new command to get the indexing started? Context being I already have payloads/docs loaded into this collection.

I have a collection distributed across several shards. Now the development has come to a point where we need to maintain multiple replicas of those shards. I have two and a half questions regarding that:\n1. Is it possible to change replication factor of the collection using update collection parameters API method? (In the main docs it is stated, that replication factor could only be specified during collection creation, while API docs contain replication factor in PATCH collections/{collection_name} method examples) \n2. If not, is there a built-in way to copy one collections content to another (differently named for example) collection, or it should be done with one's own code?\n2.5. If replication factor can only be specified during collection creation, is there by any chance a close release that changes that? (meaning, should we invest resources into recreating collections, or should we wait for a next release?:))\nThanks for your help in advance!","timestamp":"2024-03-03T14:52:15.525000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1213861507058896997","filename":"image.png","size":182104,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1213861506161180722/1213861507058896997/image.png?ex=66364b9f&is=6634fa1f&hm=ba346c66412de5f458892208c95d40828bd49a93f610c7ef8c843700ca89c564&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1213861506161180722/1213861507058896997/image.png?ex=66364b9f&is=6634fa1f&hm=ba346c66412de5f458892208c95d40828bd49a93f610c7ef8c843700ca89c564&","width":1166,"height":1486,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":1,"placeholder":"TOcBBQB/I62Zxom4aWc2JJ/P/ujc","placeholder_version":1}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"great_frosty"},{"id":"1213609534308749322","channel_id":"1213593748898971708","author":{"id":"1207626283899691009","username":"samir_80452","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Samir @Qdrant","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"You can see it, in the docker settings","timestamp":"2024-03-02T22:11:00.754000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"samir_80452"},{"id":"1213609502285242378","channel_id":"1213593748898971708","author":{"id":"1207626283899691009","username":"samir_80452","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Samir @Qdrant","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Hello,\n\nCan you show how much memory you allow to docker ?","timestamp":"2024-03-02T22:10:53.119000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"samir_80452"},{"id":"1213593748898971708","channel_id":"1213593748898971708","author":{"id":"895391772878979073","username":"__dunno","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jayant Pranjal","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Hiii, I am using docker in mac m1 8GB to build qdrant using command \n``` docker build . --tag=qdrant/qdrant\n```\nbut each time it fails with the error:","timestamp":"2024-03-02T21:08:17.219000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1213593749175926794","filename":"message.txt","size":16340,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1213593748898971708/1213593749175926794/message.txt?ex=6635fb01&is=6634a981&hm=87ee25a0759402f84377bf58561eed9ae8a8f500a25063c8f8820c6426d714fa&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1213593748898971708/1213593749175926794/message.txt?ex=6635fb01&is=6634a981&hm=87ee25a0759402f84377bf58561eed9ae8a8f500a25063c8f8820c6426d714fa&","content_type":"text/plain;

I add two chunks to the knowledge base, I run the code and the console output prints this:\n\nCollection Info: status=<CollectionStatus.GREEN: 'green'> optimizer_status=<OptimizersStatusOneOf.OK: 'ok'> vectors_count=19 indexed_vectors_count=0 points_count=19 segments_count=2 \n\nSo everything looks good, the vectors and points counts is 19 because of the 2 chunks added. \nThen I started to test and after the first message I refreshed the \"Collection Info\" webpage and checked the number of vectors and points count and the number was 36 (looks like the 19 of the beginning plus the 17 of the previous version). Anyway all the questions had the right answer, also the question related to the two new chunks added to knowledge base.\n\nAfter other few messages, I asked again a question related to new chunks and the bot didn't respond correctly, as in the same question of 3 previous messages. I refreshed again the \"Collection Info\" webpage and checked the number of vectors and points count and the number was 17, so the same number of vectors of the collection before running the code. I continued to test, but both counts were 17 for the rest of the session.\n\nthis is just an example, in other sessions the \"behaviour\" of the collection was different, but the end was the same\nThere is something wrong regarding the creation of the collection and its updates. The issue could be related to a not update version of dependencies, because the code stopped to work 10 days ago after Langchain-related dependencies' updates and I installed the previous versions of the dependencies to have the bot active and working properly. In the next message I'm going to provide the code and the list of dependencies","timestamp":"2024-02-25T12:57:03.777000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"ricasco"},{"id":"1211290960667877396","channel_id":"1210621963471552552","author":{"id":"785095666988613662","username":"khushi2909","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Khushi Pitroda","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"and can you please provide me search option like if I want to search if certain payload already exist in collection without having to search with vector","timestamp":"2024-02-25T12:37:49.721000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"channel_id":"1210621963471552552","message_id":"1210621963471552552","guild_id":"907569970500743200"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1210621963471552552","content":"Can we do indexing and see last collection point or id of last point?\n\nAlso I want to search if the perticluar ID is already in collection or not how do we check it without query vector?\n\n        #if condition applied  - change\n        filter_condition = models.Filter(\n        must=[\n                models.FieldCondition(\n                    key=id\n                )\n            ]\n        )\n        result_description = client.search(\n            collection_name=collection_name,\n            query_filter=filter_condition\n        )\nsomething like this?\n\nThanks in advance üôÇ","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-02-23T16:19:28.360000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-02-23T16:20:03.829000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1210621963471552552","author":{"id":"785095666988613662","username":"khushi2909","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Khushi Pitroda","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},"components":[],"position":12,"userName":"khushi2909"},{"id":"1211290626570584095","channel_id":"1210621963471552552","author":{"id":"785095666988613662","username":"khushi2909","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Khushi Pitroda","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Sorry for late reply, as it was weekend,\n\nI just want to have an index thats why if I have last point and ive id as payload I'll use id as index. and next point's index will be id+1","timestamp":"2024-02-25T12:36:30.066000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"419039540821491724","username":"ffuugoo","avatar":"5eb840d9afd43e2a9a1522af4ac7b8d5","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Roman Titov","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"channel_id":"1210621963471552552","message_id":"1210624529051680828","guild_id":"907569970500743200"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":19,"channel_id":"1210621963471552552","content":"> accessing last point of a collection\nCan you please clarify what do you mean by this (and how you plan to use it)?

consumer continuously reads embeddings (and the document payload) from a Kafka topic and ingests them into Qdrant cloud.\n\nFor small chunks of text (like product descriptions) this works fine, but for larger chunks (e.g 4000 chars) it can take a while to ingest, and I've even had the Kafka consumer time out because qdrant ingestion exceeded the default time limit.\n\nI know its more common to upload data in bulk, and I've seen the optimizations suggested here: https://qdrant.tech/documentation/tutorials/bulk-upload/\n\nBut are there any other optimizations specific to ingesting from a data stream that would apply here?\n\nContext: Someone on LinkedIn asked (in relation to the article) \"what streaming insert rate into qdrant can we expect?\" but there are so many variables, its difficult to answer.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7163206559823601666?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7163206559823601666%2C7163317435142430720%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287163317435142430720%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7163206559823601666%29","timestamp":"2024-02-16T09:58:03.212000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://qdrant.tech/documentation/tutorials/bulk-upload/","title":"Bulk
