I have experimented with tuning optimizer configs on each collection, disabling indexing since the collections have fewer than 20,000 points as well as enabling it. I tuned `default_segment_number` to match the vCPU in my cloud cluster (though my understanding is the default of zero will default to the number of CPUs, so I didn't expect this to have any impact). I did not change `memmap_threshold` because this did not seem like a lever that would unlock any decrease in latency.\n\nUltimately, my question is, am I perhaps configuring things wrong and not really actually triggering any of the benefits of quantization, and the latency decrease is more likely simply that these test collections have far fewer points than the original ones with no quantization (385 vs 1,076,973 and 9,724 vs 73,670)? Or is perhaps my 20% improvement aligned with the more average case improvement from using binary quantization? I seem to have mostly exhausted available avenues within qdrant to decrease latency.

To decrease latency as much as possible, I wanted to evaluate the impact of using binary quantization. I created two new collections with binary quantization enabled and uploaded the full set of points of the portion of the data set relevant to the query, including payloads from the existing collections without quantization to the new ones with quantization. The new collection with the positive points has roughly 400 points, and the target collection where recommendations are sought has roughly 10,000 points. This target collection also has the payload indexed as with the original collection (however, in testing many permutations of the query to try to pinpoint sources of latency, removing the filter resulted in negligible latency improvement (which I'd expect since my understanding is indexed portions of a payload are stored in memory), so it does not appear to be a significant contributing factor).\n\nPerforming this same query targeting the two new collections with binary quantization decreases the latency from, on average, around 1.3s to 1.5s to, on average, around 1.0s to 1.2s. While 100+ms speed up is welcome, the documentation touts up to a 40x speed up.

A keyword filter is applied to the payload (which is indexed). I also specify a limit and similarity threshold. For the query I am testing against the candidate set of points after applying the payload filter is on the order of 10,000.

Since the collection is used in production, how do I update all points in a partition (for example partitioned on a payload field called group_id) without downtime? I have a solution with alias, where I'll create a new collection with the updates and atomically delete and update alias. But this seems too much overhead for a simple update operation.

One of our use cases is for part of a recommendation engine. We embed items and then recommend them to users. Part of the algorithm of what to show next involves cosine similarity, which we implement with Qdrant search. There are about 50-100k different items/vectors and the key is that users should not see items that were recommended to them in the past again. Right now we are implementing this with a must_not filter on the IDs of all seen items, which we are storing separately. However this doesn't seem very scalable (?) once we reach >1k previously seen items per user, which we are getting to quickly for some users. Any thoughts/recommendations for this use case? Can Qdrant handle >1k or even >10k must_not filters by id? Should we handle this by post-processing instead -> having qdrant return hundreds of results and then do post-processing to remove already-seen ones with a bloom filter or Redis or some other efficient algorithm?","timestamp":"2024-02-06T13:53:48.968000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"roman1232934"},{"id":"1204422198203387944","channel_id":"1202986503714771044","author":{"id":"270582775227219969","username":"merfik","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"MerFik","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"up","timestamp":"2024-02-06T13:43:49.134000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-02-06T13:43:53.752000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":11,"userName":"merfik"},{"id":"1204396452877570072","channel_id":"1204337568431341608","author":{"id":"144524348114337792","username":"timvisee","avatar":"c07652e0135d52704221e3d5fd61cdcd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"timvisee","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Thank you for wanting to dive into it anyway!","timestamp":"2024-02-06T12:01:30.970000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üöÄ"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"timvisee"},{"id":"1204396212271190026","channel_id":"1204385728306618398","author":{"id":"144524348114337792","username":"timvisee","avatar":"c07652e0135d52704221e3d5fd61cdcd","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"timvisee","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Yes.

(on one shard)\n* When a user joins a group, it involves duplicating the content of another member who is already part of the group: \"scroll through points where group_id is <group_id> and user_id is <already_a_member_id> and store it with the new user_id\".
