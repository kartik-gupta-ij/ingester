During the conference, our system records content from various sources and converts it to embeddings.\n\nI'd like to learn more about Qdrant and see if it is a good fit with our system. Here are a couple of questions:\n\n- Ideally we would like each meeting to be encapsulated in an isolated collection of vectors, for various reasons, such as improved retrieval, access permissions etc. I was looking at one of the threads from earlier today that mentioned too many collections being an anti-pattern in Qdrant. I am curious to hear your thoughts about our use case.\n\n- As a follow up question, I am also curious to learn more about the metadata filtering approach that Qdrant takes. I could imagine emulating the isolation above by querying on metadata, but these queries tend to degrade performance. How is metadata filtering implemented? All I could  find on the subject is: https://qdrant.tech/articles/filtrable-hnsw/ but it is unclear if this is the currently used approach and how performant it is.\n\n- How does memory management work in Qdrant?

Previously, we have been using Qdrant Cloud, but now we are interested in deploying on our own. I have a couple of questions regarding this transition:\n\n1. Is it possible to directly migrate our data from Qdrant Cloud to our self-hosted environment on AWS?\n\n2. What is the recommended deployment approach for a dataset that fits within 64GB of memory? I'm considering different options such as:\n   - A single EC2 instance with 64GB of memory\n   - Four EC2 instances, each with 16GB of memory\n   - A Kubernetes setup (probably EKS, if we choose AWS)\n\nGiven our team's limited familiarity with Kubernetes and considering management costs, a single EC2 instance seems to be a feasible option. However, I am curious to know if this is a generally recommended practice or if there are better alternatives.\n\nAny guidance or best practices you can provide on this matter would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest regards","timestamp":"2024-01-03T19:10:21.372000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"kenshin1360"},{"id":"1192159069167960134","channel_id":"1192079882449076254","author":{"id":"700197412735680563","username":"luis.cossio","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Luis Coss√≠o","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Can you try building a MRE (minimum reproducible example)?

Example:\n\n`PUT /collections/variants_alias/points\n{\n    \"points\": [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"5c56c793-69f3-4fbf-87e6-c4bf54c28c26\",\n            \"payload\": {\"color\": \"red\"},\n            \"vector\": [0.9, 0.1, 0.1]\n        }\n    ]\n}`\n\nFinally, all points are upserted with 1024 size embeddings to variants_alias.\n\nThe final step would be to delete the alias variants_alias:\n\n`POST /collections/aliases\n{\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"delete_alias\": {\n                \"alias_name\": \"variants_alias\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}`\n\nThe alias is now deleted and the \"variants\" collection has now the 1024 size vector and all the points that where upserted to variants_alias. The legacy 768 size vector was also deleted.\n\nI know its very likely I'm wrong on many things. I am new at this so would appreciate any guidance.\n\nThanks for the help!","timestamp":"2023-12-27T22:01:34.517000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"franknoro"},{"id":"1189684372287275030","channel_id":"1189679585336512653","author":{"id":"844295650400534599","username":"andrey.vasnetsov","avatar":"79926befe1322d1155b0723e0aeb5fab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"andrey.vasnetsov","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"You can also use aliases to make the switch atomic","timestamp":"2023-12-27T21:40:57.620000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":1,"userName":"andrey.vasnetsov"},{"id":"1189684317065056426","channel_id":"1189679585336512653","author":{"id":"844295650400534599","username":"andrey.vasnetsov","avatar":"79926befe1322d1155b0723e0aeb5fab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"andrey.vasnetsov","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"> Does this means that in order to use the new Cohere's model I have to delete all my points, then change the configuration of the vector size to 1024 and then re upload the points?\n\nSafer option would be to create another collection along the existing one and then switch from one collection to another","timestamp":"2023-12-27T21:40:44.454000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"andrey.vasnetsov"},{"id":"1189679585336512653","channel_id":"1189679585336512653","author":{"id":"857806122815979540","username":"franknoro","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"franknoro","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Hello,\n\nI use Cohere's (https://docs.cohere.com/reference/embed)  embed-multilingual-v2.0 (768 vector size) model to generate embeddings but now I want to switch to embed-multilingual-v3.0 (1024 vector size).\n\nCurrently, my Qdrant db uses only 1 vector with 768 size (since I use embed-multilingual-v2.0). \n\nDoes this means that in order to use the new Cohere's model I have to delete all my points, then change the configuration of the vector size to 1024 and then re upload the points?\n\nThis just sounds like I'd be doing something wrong, since embeddings models will be changing frequently overtime and deleting the vectors or points every time this happens doesn't sound like a good practice.\n\nI'd appreciate any guidance on what are the good practices here.

Keep in mind that every GKE will reserve some resources for the OS, i.e. a n1-standard-2 (2cores/7.5gb) you only have roughly 1.8c/5.7gb available for pods/containers.\n\nThe helm chart can be used on both, GKE autopilot & regular GKE. \n\n> Also, do I need to deploy a loadbalaner on GKE to publicly access qdrant or is this handled by the helm chart? \n\nAs Andrey mentioned, the helm chart does not provide an ingress.\nThe GKE documentation has a great document on using the ingress controller that GKE provides: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress","timestamp":"2023-12-22T12:40:58.396000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":4,"components":[],"position":6,"userName":"mrincompetent"},{"id":"1187686272232345651","channel_id":"1185239282739335248","author":{"id":"644344117140389929","username":"russcam","avatar":"202b5a7566f7d8c0619841098d64a6cc","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Russ Cam","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"@null one small change to make when using the example version for the first time - change `RecreateCollectionAsync(...)` to `CreateCollectionAsync(...)`.

We started receiving 503 service unavailable errors. Upon inspecting the logs, it was clear that we were running out of memory.\nThe metrics indicated a continuous increase in RAM usage without any subsequent decrease. After restarting the cluster, the issue persisted. It was only resolved when we deleted all the collections.\nIn our app, we utilize 'knowledge bases', which can consist of one or multiple embedded files. Our approach has been to create a new collection for each knowledge base.\nAccording to our research and documentation review, it's recommended to store all knowledge bases in a single collection, using fields like knowledgebase_id in the payload. This approach should include filtering that field for context retrieval of the wanted knowledge base. Also, we found that using In Disk storage and indexing on the knowledgebase_id field will help us mitigate this issue.\nWe're considering implementing these changes and possibly exploring quantization if necessary.\nWe would greatly appreciate your insights and suggestions on this situation. Any additional best practices or improvements are welcome.","timestamp":"2023-12-20T13:41:06.036000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"houssemmasriad"},{"id":"1187008093310156860","channel_id":"1186651440735858768","author":{"id":"308455881350053888","username":"chantlong","avatar":"2c22e518b557474f49f7801d864856e9","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"chantlong","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"thanks!","timestamp":"2023-12-20T12:26:22.989000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":16,"userName":"chantlong"},{"id":"1186996941809258538","channel_id":"1186651440735858768","author":{"id":"844295650400534599","username":"andrey.vasnetsov","avatar":"79926befe1322d1155b0723e0aeb5fab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"andrey.vasnetsov","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"yes, it's better to apply a payload index","timestamp":"2023-12-20T11:42:04.264000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üëçüèª"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":15,"userName":"andrey.vasnetsov"},{"id":"1186992040408514570","channel_id":"1186992040408514570","author":{"id":"308455881350053888","username":"chantlong","avatar":"2c22e518b557474f49f7801d864856e9","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"chantlong","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Maybe this isn't the right place to post since I'm using Llama Index but when running the following code and assuming the documents=NOTES I pass in have a length of 2500, I would assume I get vectors_count / points_count of at least 2500. if something gets chunked I should get even more records in the vector db.\n\n\nBut I end up with 1400-ish.

I am reaching out for assistance as I am facing challenges adapting the following tutorial using the Qdrant-dotnet library : https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/vector_databases/qdrant/using_qdrant_for_embeddings_search. This tutorial outlines a method for adding points with two distinct vectors to a Qdrant collection using Python. My goal is to achieve the same operation using .Net with the Qdrant-dotnet library.\n\nSummary of the Issue:\nI am having difficulty figuring out how to add two vectors to the same PointStruct object with QdrantClient. Could you provide an example to help me create the collection and PointStruct with QdrantClient in the same way as outlined in the tutorial?\n\nQdrant Configuration:\nI am using Qdrant locally with Docker.\n\nConnection to Qdrant:\nI am using the qdrant/qdrant-dotnet library, available at this address: https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-dotnet#readme\n\nDatabase Configuration:\nI would like to successfully create a collection identical to the one presented in the tutorial.\n\nI would appreciate your guidance on resolving these specific issues.
