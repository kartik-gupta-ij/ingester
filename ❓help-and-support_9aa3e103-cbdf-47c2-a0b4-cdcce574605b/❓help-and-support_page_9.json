If not, then should we recreate payload indices by deleting/creating them after lage batch uploading at all, or do we just create them once and leave them be?\n4. Generalizing the previous question: what is the best way to update a collection (that has a payload with indices) on a production server (so that its indices must always be ready for fast search querying)?","timestamp":"2023-12-11T07:12:47.392000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2023-12-11T07:21:12.387000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":2,"userName":"illumaria"},{"id":"1183667677533839480","channel_id":"1183667450588438558","author":{"id":"260628512929611778","username":"illumaria","avatar":"2dcec0715cdf7a27e819b403ffd421a6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Dmitry

So I guess qdrant read many tiny files when query? But repeat this query will NOT cause this, disk util rate remains 0%.\n```\nDevice:         rrqm/s   wrqm/s     r/s     w/s    rMB/s    wMB/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await r_await w_await  svctm  %util\nsdb               0.00     0.00 1353.00    0.00     5.29     0.00     8.00     2.99    2.02    2.02    0.00   0.74 100.10\n```\n\nI try to replicate this question in dev environment, I create a collection with same structure and fill over 5 million points in it. But the time cost of search is below 200ms in average. And there's no disk busy like product env.\n\nI guess there are some reasons may cause this:\n- Some of points contains a large payload (a list property with more than 3000 elements) \n- Quering when adding new points to collection(usually 15 points per minute), maybe them are not indexed and must be readed from disk. (There's no adding new points in dev environment)\n\nSo what causes this?

So, I built a function to format these answers in the following way:\n\nThe suggested Chinese restaurants in Toronto are:\n1) Mandarin Restaurant\n📞: +14164862222\n 📍: https://maps.app.goo.gl/5w5n73xbAG9AasYW9\n2) Hong Shing Restaurant \n📞: +14169773338\n 📍: https://maps.app.goo.gl/6cUxj32T4j1n4ZkL7\n3) Yueh Tung Restaurant\n📞: +14169770933\n📍: https://maps.app.goo.gl/3y3dgFTtc2tyrHYo9\n\nI built a functions that I will paste in the next message\n\nUnfortunately, the bot only formats the answer correctly in a few cases.

RAM is directly mapped to disk.

Doing that will likely resolve any memory congestion issues you currently might be having as well.

looking for advice with troubleshooting slow searches with large filters. \n\nSetup: \n- Docker Qdrant \n- Deployed to Amazon EKS\n- 4GB RAM per pod\n- CPU 600m per pod\n- 12 replicas\n- 24 shards\n- Index on a field called \"locationId\"\n- Connecting to qdrant using the python client\n- 12,624,912 vector count\n- Querying with a filter with 8,000 items.\n\nWhat I'm experiencing is very slow (greater than 10 second) searches when adding large filters. I define a large filter as a filter with a must clause on that indexed \"locationId\" field where the array has more than 1,000 items. Most of the time, results just time out. Remove the filter and results are speedy.\n\nWhat's strange is that the dev environment is basically provisioned in the exact same way. The differences that I can tell are that dev receives less writes and has a smaller vector count: 1,887,821. Queries on my dev system don't usually time out. \n\nI'm looking for advice on diagnosing what the issue is. Why is it that it works on dev and not live?

I have millions of vectors with sizes in the 1000's. For problem-specific reasons, it's not ideal to downscale these further. I have been trying out qdrant to do vector based search given these vectors, but I'm running into prohibitively slow query times which I really hope someone could help me solve. \n\n**My usecase:**\nI need to query a vector database containing ~10 million vectors of dimension ~2000. These queries need to return the most similar vector for each query vector. Returning the top 5 or top 10 would be nice, if possible. I need to be able to process at least 100.000 query vectors pr. 24 hours, which is just around 1 query pr. second.  It is OK if parallelism is required to achieve these speeds. \n\n** What I have tried:**\nI have so far worked with a local database containing a single vector collection. I have not used the docker image because I do not have rights to run docker images locally, and I have assumed that converting it to a singularity image wouldn't work (correct me if I'm wrong!).  I have attached a MWE of my code in this message.\n\nHere's what I find using the attached MWE:\n\nFor a database containing 10.000 vectors of length 1024, I am able to execute  `QdrantClient.search(.. limit = 1)` about 11 times a second. \n\nFor a database containing 50.000 vectors of length 1024, I am able to execute `QdrantClient.search(.. limit = 1)` about 2 times a second. \n\nAs soon as the databases begin to be semi-realistic in size (~1 million vectors), the query speeds are prohibitively slow, essentially making qdrant unusable for me. \n\nThese tests were carried out on a beefy workstation with 1TB of RAM,  2X AMD EPYC CPUs and the database was stored on a fast NVME drive.\n\n\n**Could you please take a quick look and let me know  if I am missing something?**","timestamp":"2023-11-29T12:12:40.160000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1179394497071829072","filename":"database_creation_mwe.py","size":3718,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1179394496937599006/1179394497071829072/database_creation_mwe.py?ex=66362638&is=6634d4b8&hm=1bcb179e49f404054fbc23b33a4dd278703ce9a53f8a1ace8cc5bca918b40a9a&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1179394496937599006/1179394497071829072/database_creation_mwe.py?ex=66362638&is=6634d4b8&hm=1bcb179e49f404054fbc23b33a4dd278703ce9a53f8a1ace8cc5bca918b40a9a&","content_type":"text/x-python; charset=utf-8","content_scan_version":0},{"id":"1179394497411559486","filename":"query_database_mwe.py","size":1088,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1179394496937599006/1179394497411559486/query_database_mwe.py?ex=66362638&is=6634d4b8&hm=67408e2f66bf65ffc338fe51ff23c1a5612477c2e368b25d3f3894e5ef0c5cd2&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1179394496937599006/1179394497411559486/query_database_mwe.py?ex=66362638&is=6634d4b8&hm=67408e2f66bf65ffc338fe51ff23c1a5612477c2e368b25d3f3894e5ef0c5cd2&","content_type":"text/x-python; charset=utf-8","content_scan_version":0}],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"rasmusorsoe"},{"id":"1179338775013380106","channel_id":"1160250562474950696","author":{"id":"907307031457849344","username":"agourlay","avatar":"a6703decd7c0f8f6a5967c8022f4810c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"agourlay","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Which version are you running again?","timestamp":"2023-11-29T08:31:15.018000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":163,"userName":"agourlay"},{"id":"1179330173401833493","channel_id":"1160250562474950696","author":{"id":"1078259016607735898","username":"nair1975","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nair","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"This is the error log\nthread panicked while processing panic. aborting.\n./entrypoint.sh: line 25:     7 Aborted                 (core dumped) ./qdrant $@","timestamp":"2023-11-29T07:57:04.234000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"position":162,"userName":"nair1975"},{"id":"1179286041245520026","channel_id":"1160250562474950696","author":{"id":"1078259016607735898","username":"nair1975","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Nair","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Noticed that qdrant crashed while setting indexing threshold to 20000 AND memmap to 0.

I have an indexed  field called “object_name”. There may be multiple points stored that have the same “object_name” field. I want to get all the points that match the object name, average their vector and then get similar points to the average vector.\n\nTo do this I am doing it in two steps. First do a scroll with the “object_name”:\n\n```\nPOST /collections/{collection_name}/points/scroll\n\n{\n    \"filter\": {\n        \"must\": [\n            { \"key\": \"object_name\", \"match\": { \"value\": \"object_1\" } },\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen use the ids of the points returned in the positive field with the recommendation search:\n\n```\nPOST /collections/{collection_name}/points/recommend\n{\n  \"positive\": [15, 27, 38],\n  \"filter\": {\n        \"must_not\": [\n            {\n                \"key\": \"object_name\",\n                \"match\": {\n                    \"value\": \"object_1\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n  },\n  \"strategy\": \"average_vector\",\n  \"limit\": 10\n\n}\n```\n\nNow let’s say I want to do this approach for a list 50 object_names. For the recommendation part I can use the batch recommendation API. But to get the point IDs needed for the “positive” field in recommendation I am currently doing 50 scroll filters (one for each object_name in my list). Mainly I am wondering if there is a way here where I could get all of the point IDs I need in one go. For example if it was possible to do a batch scroll where each filter is just a match filter with an object ID that returned a list of points.","timestamp":"2023-11-21T15:49:53.412000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"700197412735680563","username":"luis.cossio","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Luis Cossío","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"channel_id":"1176512591787462706","message_id":"1176521753699299328","guild_id":"907569970500743200"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1176512591787462706","content":"Ah, looks like I didn't understand what you wanted to do at first.

In particular, I am talking about the following code (providing just the differing parts):\n- `qdrant-client` (`cpu_count() == 16`):\n```python\nqdrant_client = QdrantHook(conn_id=qdrant_conn_id).get_conn()\n\nqdrant_client.upload_collection(\n    collection_name=collection_nm,\n    ids=item_ids,\n    vectors=vectors,\n    payload=payload,\n    batch_size=batchsize,\n    parallel=cpu_count(),\n    max_retries=10,\n)\n```\n- `HttpHook`:\n```python\nqdrant_hook = QdrantHook(qdrant_conn_id=qdrant_conn_id)\noffset = 0\nwhile True:\n    batch_ids = item_ids[offset : offset + batchsize]\n    batch_vectors = vectors[offset : offset + batchsize]\n\n    if not batch_ids:\n        break\n\n    params = {\"ids\": batch_ids, \"vectors\": batch_vectors}\n\n    if s3_payload_path:\n        params[\"payloads\"] = payload[offset : offset + batchsize]\n\n    batch = Batch(**params)\n    qdrant_hook.upsert_points(\n        wait=True, points=batch, collection_name=collection_nm\n    )\n\n    offset += batchsize\n```\n\nWe can see the following when looking at the uploading times for the same collection (same vectors, same payloads, same collection settings - I just uploaded once with one method, then removed the collection and did the same with another method):\n- `qdrant-client`:\n  - 16 processes (!!!), so should be damn fast due to parallelism!\n  - batch size: 512\n  - upload time for 654783 points: 24 m 50 s\n  - QPS: 439 points/s\n- `HttpHook`:\n  - 1 synchronous (!) process\n  - batch size: 1024\n  - upload time for 654783 points: 5 m 43 s\n  - QPS: 1909 points/s\n\nNow, I understand that `qdrant-client` has a lot of auxiliary work to do under the hood, but for it to become THAT slower?..
